to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
(email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
eventually go with a particular format?</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it

for web documents. Nice environments for web documents, such as
Sphinx, Markdown, or plain HTML, are not particularly well
suited for thesis and books. IPython notebooks are ideal for
documenting computational experiments, but do not (yet) meet the
requirements of books and thesis.</paragraph><paragraph>What about migrating a part of a book for blogging? What about making
an MS Word version of parts or an untagged text for inclusion in
email?  What about efficiently generating slides in modern HTML5
style?  Doconce enables all this with just <emphasis>one source</emphasis> (the slogan is
<emphasis>document once - include anywhere</emphasis>).
Doconce also
has many extra features for supporting documents with much code and
mathematics, not found in any of the mentioned formats.</paragraph></section><section ids="basic-syntax" names="basic\ syntax"><title>Basic Syntax</title><paragraph>Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">======= First a Section Heading =======

Section headings have 7 equality characters before and after the heading.
With 9 characters we have a chapter heading, 5 gives a subsection
heading, and 3 a subsubsection heading.

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

__Hyperlinks.__ Paragraph headings are surrounded by double underscores.
URLs with a link word are possible, as in &quot;hpl&quot;: &quot;http://folk.uio.no/hpl&quot;.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;tutorial.do.txt&quot;. Doconce distinguishes between paper
and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
generated from Doconce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
&quot;label&quot; command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments of the form [name: comment] (with
a space after `name:`), e.g., such as [hpl: here I will make some
remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
by a command-line argument (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an
example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |

allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in formats
not supporting LaTeX mathematics
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$</literal_block><paragraph>The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula. If you write a lot of mathematics, only the
output formats <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>pdflatex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, <literal>sphinx</literal>, and <literal>pandoc</literal>
are of interest
and all these support inline LaTeX mathematics so then you will naturally
drop the pipe symbol and write just:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">$\nu = \sin(x)$</literal_block><paragraph>However, if you want more textual formats, like plain text or reStructuredText,
the text after the pipe symbol may help to make the math formula more readable
if there are backslahes or other special LaTeX symbols in the LaTeX code.</paragraph><paragraph>Blocks of mathematics are typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> (begin TeX, end TeX) instructions:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
!et</literal_block><paragraph>The result looks like this:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}</literal_block><paragraph>Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>pdflatex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, and <literal>sphinx</literal>). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.</paragraph><paragraph>You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<literal>!bc</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal> instructions, respectively:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">!bc pycod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
!ec</literal_block><paragraph>Such blocks are formatted as:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)</literal_block><paragraph>A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to <literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>rst</literal>, and formats close to plain text),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.</paragraph><paragraph>One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!).</paragraph><paragraph>Another document can be included by writing <literal># #include &quot;mynote.do.txt&quot;</literal>
at the beginning of a line.  Doconce documents have
extension <literal>do.txt</literal>. The <literal>do</literal> part stands for doconce, while the
trailing <literal>.txt</literal> denotes a text document so that editors gives you
plain text editing capabilities.</paragraph><target refid="newcommands"/></section><section ids="macros-newcommands-cross-references-index-and-bibliography newcommands" names="macros\ (newcommands),\ cross-references,\ index,\ and\ bibliography newcommands"><title>Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography</title><paragraph>Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <emphasis>newcommand</emphasis>
construction.  The newcommands are defined in files with names
<literal>newcommands*.tex</literal>, using standard LaTeX syntax. Only newcommands
for use inside math environments are supported.</paragraph><paragraph>Labels, corss-references, citations, and support of an index and
bibliography are much inspired by LaTeX syntax, but Doconce features
no backslashes. Use labels for sections and equations only, and
preceed the reference by &quot;Section&quot; or &quot;Chapter&quot;, or in case of
an equation, surround the reference by parenthesis.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">===== My Section =====
label{sec:mysec}

idx{key equation} idx{$\u$ conservation}

We refer to Section ref{sec:yoursec} for background material on
the *key equation*. Here we focus on the extension

# \Ddt, \u and \mycommand are defined in newcommands_keep.tex

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Ddt{\u} = \mycommand{v},
label{mysec:eq:Dudt}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\Ddt{\u}$ is the material derivative of $\u$.
Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important in a number
of contexts, see cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.

As see in Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig}, the key equation
features large, smooth regions *and* abrupt changes.

such a makefile, more precisely a Bash script <literal>make.sh</literal>, which

various options that can be added to the basic commands.
A handy feature of the generated <literal>make.sh</literal> script is that it
inserts checks for successful runs of the <literal>doconce format</literal> commands,
and if something goes wrong, the <literal>make.sh</literal> exits.</paragraph></section><section ids="preprocessing" names="preprocessing"><title>Preprocessing</title><paragraph>The <literal>preprocess</literal> and <literal>mako</literal> programs are used to preprocess the

defined as <literal>latex</literal>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <literal>#if FORMAT == &quot;latex&quot;</literal>

of a &quot;notes feature&quot; is so easy using the <literal>preprocess</literal> or <literal>mako</literal>
programs. Just introduce some variable, say <literal>NOTES</literal>, that you define
through <literal>-DNOTES</literal> (or not) when running <literal>doconce format ...</literal>. Inside
the document you place your notes between <literal># #ifdef NOTES</literal> and
<literal># #endif</literal> preprocess tags. Alternatively you use <literal>% if NOTES:</literal>
and <literal>% endif</literal> that <literal>mako</literal> will recognize. In the same way you may
encapsulate unfinished material, extra material to be removed
for readers but still nice to archive as part of the document for
future revisions.</paragraph></section><section ids="demo-of-different-formats" names="demo\ of\ different\ formats"><title>Demo of different formats</title><paragraph>A simple scientific report is available in <reference name="a lot of different formats" refuri="http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/doconce_commands.html">a lot of different formats</reference><target ids="a-lot-of-different-formats" names="a\ lot\ of\ different\ formats" refuri="http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/doconce_commands.html"/>.

of text, <literal>%(title)s</literal> for the title, and <literal>%(date)s</literal> for the date.
Doconce comes with a few templates. The usage of templates is
described in a <reference name="separate document" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html">separate document</reference><target ids="separate-document" names="separate\ document" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html"/>. That document describes how you your Doconce-generated
HTML file can have any specified layout.</paragraph><paragraph>The HTML file can be embedded in a template with your own tailored
design, see a &quot;tutorial&quot;: &quot; <reference name="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html">https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html</reference><target ids="https-doconce-googlecode-com-hg-doc-design-wrapper-tech-html" names="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/design/wrapper_tech.html"/>&quot; on this topic. The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three &quot;slots&quot;: <literal>%(title)s</literal> for a title,
<literal>%(date)s</literal> for a date, and <literal>%(main)s</literal> for the main body of text. The
latter is the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, or the title (but a title is not
recommended when using templates). The date is extracted from the
<literal>DATE:</literal> line. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. Doconce comes with
two templates in <literal>bundled/html_styles</literal>. Just copy the directory
containing the template and the CSS and JavaScript files to your
document directory, edit the template as needed (also check that
paths to the <literal>css</literal> and <literal>js</literal> subdirectories are correct - according
to how you store the template files), and run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc --html_template=mytemplate.html</literal_block><paragraph>The template in <literal>style_vagrant</literal> also needs an extra option
<literal>--html_style=vagrant</literal>. With this style, one has nice navigation buttons
that are used if the document contains <literal>!split</literal> commands for splitting
it into many pages.</paragraph></section><section ids="the-html-file-collection" names="the\ html\ file\ collection"><title>The HTML File Collection</title><paragraph>There are usually a range of files needed for an HTML document arising
from a Doconce source. The needed files are listed in
<literal>.basename_html_file_collection</literal>, where <literal>basename</literal> is the filestem of
the Doconce file (i.e., the Doconce source is in <literal>basename.do.txt</literal>).</paragraph></section><section ids="filenames" names="filenames"><title>Filenames</title><paragraph>An HTML version of a Doconce document is often made in different styles,
calling for a need to rename the HTML output file. This is conveniently
done by the <literal>--html_output=basename</literal> option, where <literal>basename</literal> is the
filestem of the associated HTML files. The
<literal>.basename_html_file_collection</literal> file lists all the needed files
for the HTML document. Here is an example on making three versions of
the HTML document: <literal>mydoc_bloodish.html</literal>, <literal>mydoc_solarized</literal>, and

From this format one can go to numerous other formats:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>Pandoc supports <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, <literal>odt</literal> (OpenOffice), <literal>docx</literal> (Microsoft
Word), <literal>rtf</literal>, <literal>texinfo</literal>, to mention some. The <literal>-R</literal> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <literal>--toc</literal> option generates a table of contents.
See the <reference name="Pandoc documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</reference><target ids="pandoc-documentation" names="pandoc\ documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"/>
for the many features of the <literal>pandoc</literal> program. The HTML output from
<literal>pandoc</literal> needs adjustments to provide full support for MathJax LaTeX
mathematics, and for this purpose one should use <literal>doconce md2html</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce m2html mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>The result <literal>mydoc.html</literal> can be viewed in a browser.</paragraph><paragraph>Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS
Word.  There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your
document): <literal>doconce format pandoc</literal> and then translating using <literal>doconce
md2latex</literal> (which runs <literal>pandoc</literal>), or <literal>doconce format latex</literal>, and then
going from LaTeX to the desired format using <literal>pandoc</literal>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce replace '\Verb!' '\verb!' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>When we go through <literal>pandoc</literal>, only single equations, <literal>align</literal>, or <literal>align*</literal>
environments are well understood for output to HTML.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that Doconce applies the <literal>Verb</literal> macro from the <literal>fancyvrb</literal> package
while <literal>pandoc</literal> only supports the standard <literal>verb</literal> construction for
inline verbatim text.  Moreover, quite some additional <literal>doconce
replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal> edits might be needed on the <literal>.mkd</literal> or
<literal>.tex</literal> files to successfully have mathematics that is well translated
to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using Pandoc, it can
be advantageous to go via LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>-s</literal> option adds a proper header and footer to the <literal>mydoc.html</literal> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.</paragraph><section ids="github-flavored-markdown" names="github-flavored\ markdown"><title>GitHub-flavored Markdown</title><paragraph>Adding the command-line option <literal>github-md</literal> turns on the GutHub-flavored
Markdown dialect, which is used for the issue tracker on <reference name="GitHub" refuri="http://github.com">GitHub</reference><target ids="github" names="github" refuri="http://github.com"/>. A special feature is the support of task lists:
unnumbered lists with <literal>[x]</literal> (task done) or <literal>[ ]</literal> (task not done).
(Tables get typeset directly as HTML and the syntax for code highlighting
is different from Pandoc extended Markdown.) Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">!bquote

There is a problem with the `f(x)` function

!bc pycod

OK, this is fixed:

!bc pycod
def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c
!ec

===== Updated task list =====

   * [x] Offer an `f(x)` function

the packages listed in the default preamble are required and must be
present in <literal>myfile</literal>). Otherwise, <literal>myfile</literal> is assumed to contain
<emphasis>additional</emphasis> LaTeX code to be added to the Doconce default preamble.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>ptex2tex</literal> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <literal>!bc</literal> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>
file, e.g., <literal>!bc sys</literal> for a terminal session, where <literal>sys</literal> is set to
a certain environment in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> (e.g., <literal>CodeTerminal</literal>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.</paragraph><paragraph>Also the <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <literal>.p.tex</literal> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          &quot;sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}&quot; \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt</literal_block><paragraph>Note that <literal>@</literal> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <literal>minted</literal>
above, which implies <literal>\begin{minted}{fortran}</literal> and <literal>\end{minted}</literal> as
begin and end for blocks inside <literal>!bc fpro</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal>).  Specifying
<literal>envir=ans:nt</literal> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<literal>anslistings.sty</literal> package, e.g., <literal>!bc cppcod</literal> will then result in
<literal>\begin{c++}</literal>. A predefined shortcut as in <literal>shcod=Verbatim-0.85</literal>
results in denser
vertical spacing (baselinestretch 0.85 in LaTeX terminology), and
<literal>shcod=Verbatim-indent</literal> implies indentation of the verbatim text.
Alternatively, one can provide all desired parameters
<literal>\begin{Verbatim}</literal> instruction using the syntax illustrated for
the <literal>sys</literal> environments above.</paragraph><paragraph>If no environments like <literal>sys</literal>, <literal>fpro</literal>, or the common
<literal>envir</literal> are defined on the command line, the plain <literal>\begin{Verbatim}</literal>
and <literal>\end{Verbatim}</literal> instructions are used.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2b (optional).</emphasis> Edit the <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <literal>section</literal> by <literal>section*</literal> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
You will use <literal>doconce replace</literal> to edit <literal>section{</literal> to <literal>section*{</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>For fixing the line break of a title, you may pick a word in the
title, say &quot;Using&quot;, and insert a break after than word. With
<literal>doconce subst</literal> this is easy employing regular expressions with
a group before &quot;Using&quot; and a group after:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file so the <literal>doconce subst</literal> or
<literal>doconce replace</literal> commands can be put inside the script.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Compile <literal>mydoc.tex</literal>
and create the PDF file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; latex mydoc

We have automated
most of the steps through the <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author=&quot;authors' names&quot; \
          title=&quot;some title&quot; version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...</literal_block><paragraph>The keywords <literal>author</literal>, <literal>title</literal>, and <literal>version</literal> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <literal>version</literal> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <literal>file1</literal>,
<literal>file2</literal>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <literal>file1</literal>, <literal>file2</literal>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <literal>dirname</literal> is <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>. The <literal>theme</literal>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <literal>'default'</literal>).</paragraph><paragraph>With a single-file document in <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> one often just runs:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal> is made with
relevant files.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command generates a script
<literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
Normally, executing the script works well, but if you are new
to Sphinx and end up producing quite some Sphinx documents, I encourave
you to read the Sphinx documentation and study the <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal>
file.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Links.</emphasis> The <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> script copies directories named <literal>fig*</literal>
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  It also examines <literal>MOVIE:</literal> and <literal>FIGURE:</literal>
commands in the Doconce file to find other image files and copies
these too. I strongly recommend to put files
to which there are local links (not <literal>http:</literal> or <literal>file:</literal> URLs) in
a directory named <literal>_static</literal>. The <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> copies
<literal>_static*</literal> to the Sphinx directory, which guarantees that the links
to the local files will work in the Sphinx document.</paragraph><paragraph>There is a utility <literal>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</literal> for checking links to
local files and moving the files to <literal>_static</literal> and changing the links
accordingly. For example, a link to <literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> is changed
to <literal>_static/myfile.txt</literal> and <literal>myfile.txt</literal> is copied to <literal>_static</literal>.
However, I recommend instead that you manually copy
files to <literal>_static</literal> when you want to link to them, or let your
script which compiles the Doconce document do it automatically.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Themes.</emphasis> Doconce comes with a rich collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents,
much larger than what is found in the standard Sphinx distribution.
Additional themes include
<literal>agni</literal>,
<literal>basicstrap</literal>,
<literal>bootstrap</literal>,
<literal>cloud</literal>,
<literal>fenics</literal>,
<literal>fenics_minimal</literal>,
<literal>flask</literal>,
<literal>haiku</literal>,
<literal>impressjs</literal>,
<literal>jal</literal>,
<literal>pylons</literal>,
<literal>redcloud</literal>,
<literal>scipy_lectures</literal>,
<literal>slim-agogo</literal>, and
<literal>vlinux-theme</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>All the themes are packed out in the Sphinx directory, and the
<literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> insert lots of extra code in the <literal>conf.py</literal>
file to enable easy specification and customization of themes.
For example, modules are loaded for the additional themes that
come with Doconce, code is inserted to allow customization of
the look and feel of themes, etc. The <literal>conf.py</literal> file is a
good starting point for fine-tuning your favorite team, and your
own <literal>conf.py</literal> file can later be supplied and used when running
<literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>: simply add the command-line option
<literal>conf.py=conf.py</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>A script
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <literal>fenics</literal>, <literal>pyramid</literal>, and <literal>pylon</literal> one writes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid pylon</literal_block><paragraph>The resulting directories with HTML documents are <literal>_build/html_fenics</literal>
and <literal>_build/html_pyramid</literal>, respectively. Without arguments,
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> makes all available themes (!). With <literal>make-themes.sh</literal>
it is easy to check out various themes to find the one that is most
attractive for your document.</paragraph><paragraph>You may supply your own theme and avoid copying all the themes
that come with Doconce into the Sphinx directory. Just specify
<literal>theme_dir=path</literal> on the command line, where <literal>path</literal> is the relative
path to the directory containing the Sphinx theme. You must also
specify a configure file by <literal>conf.py=path</literal>, where <literal>path</literal> is the
relative path to your <literal>conf.py</literal> file.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Example.</emphasis> Say you like the <literal>scipy_lectures</literal> theme, but you want
a table of contents to appear <emphasis>to the right</emphasis>, much in the same style
as in the <literal>default</literal> theme (where the table of contents is to the left).
You can then run <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>, invoke a text editor with the
<literal>conf.py</literal> file, find the line <literal>html_theme == 'scipy_lectures'</literal>,
edit the following <literal>nosidebar</literal> to <literal>false</literal> and <literal>rightsidebar</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
Alternatively, you may write a little script using <literal>doconce replace</literal>
to replace a portion of text in <literal>conf.py</literal> by a new one:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doconce replace &quot;elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
    html_theme_options = {
        'nosidebar': 'true',
        'rightsidebar': 'false',
        'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
        'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
        'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
        'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
        'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
    }&quot; &quot;elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
    html_theme_options = {
        'nosidebar': 'false',
        'rightsidebar': 'true',
        'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
        'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
        'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
        'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
        'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
    }&quot; conf.py</literal_block><paragraph>Obviously, we could also have changed colors in the edit above.
The final alternative is to save the edited <literal>conf.py</literal> file somewhere
and reuse it the next time <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> is run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doconce sphinx_dir theme=scipy_lectures \
                   conf.py=../some/path/conf.py mydoc</literal_block><section ids="the-manual-sphinx-procedure" names="the\ manual\ sphinx\ procedure"><title>The manual Sphinx procedure</title><paragraph>If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained

may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> generator makes an extended <literal>conv.py</literal>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Copy the <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> file to the Sphinx root directory:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir</literal_block><paragraph>If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> in the <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>

or simply copy your figure directories to <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>.
Links to local files in <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> must be modified to links to
files in the <literal>_static</literal> directory, see comment above.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 4.</emphasis> Edit the generated <literal>index.rst</literal> file so that <literal>mydoc.rst</literal>
is included, i.e., add <literal>mydoc</literal> to the <literal>toctree</literal> section so that it becomes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>(The spaces before <literal>mydoc</literal> are important!)</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 5.</emphasis> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">make clean   # remove old versions
make html</literal_block><paragraph>Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <literal>index.html</literal> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,

and Texinfo files.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 6.</emphasis> View the result:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; firefox _build/html/index.html</literal_block><paragraph>Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <literal>!bc</literal>: <literal>cod</literal> gives Python

and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format, while
at the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book, a Sphinx web document, or a collection of HTML files.</paragraph><paragraph>The Googlecode wiki document, <literal>mydoc.gwiki</literal>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <literal>.gwiki</literal> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).</paragraph></section><section ids="tweaking-the-doconce-output" names="tweaking\ the\ doconce\ output"><title>Tweaking the Doconce Output</title><paragraph>Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<literal>.rst</literal> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <literal>.eps</literal> or <literal>.png</literal> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <literal>make.sh</literal> files in <literal>docs/manual</literal> and <literal>docs/tutorial</literal>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.</paragraph></section><section ids="demos" names="demos"><title>Demos</title><paragraph>The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doc/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt</literal_block><paragraph>The file <literal>make.sh</literal> in the <literal>tutorial</literal> directory of the
