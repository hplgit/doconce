========= Some real writing =========
label{ch:real_writing}

Let us demonstrate *emphasize text*, _bold text_, `inline monospace font`,
and of course computer code that we can copy from a part of a file
using regular expressions:

@@@CODE src/mycode.py  def f@def g
# Above we copy from def f up to, but not including,
# the def g line in mmycode.py

It is a big advantage to copy computer code directly into the book, but
you can also write it as part of the text, this time the FORTRAN equivalent:

!bc fcod
       subroutine f(x)
       real*8 x
       f = 42*x
       return
       end
!ec

Mathematics is written in plain LaTeX inside a begin-end tex environment:

!bt
\[ f(x) = 42x.\]
!et
Remember to use simple LaTeX: just the `equation`, `equation*`, `\[ ... \]`,
`align`, `align*`, `alignat`, or `alignat*` environments!
Inline mathematics makes use of dollar signs: $f(x)=42x$.

As LaTeX writer, remember that white space counts in DocOnce syntax!
Be extra careful with indentation of lists.

Also remember that DocOnce avoids backslash in label, ref and cite,
e.g., in references like cite{Chorin1968}.
