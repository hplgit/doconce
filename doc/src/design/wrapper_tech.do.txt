TITLE: Wrapping Plain HTML Files in Fancy Design Templates
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today


__Summary.__
You want to write your web pages as simple text, but at the same time you
need the design and layout to be compatible with a given look-and-feel standard.
This is easy to accomplish by writing the HTML pages in plain DocOnce text
and using *HTML templates*. The present note explains the details.

========= Example on a problem setting =========

 o You need to write web pages, say for a course, and want to have
   complete control of the core text in a plain text editor without
   paying attention to fancy layouts.
 o There might be many pages, often developing dynamically over time,
   linked to a potentially large number of files (images, computer codes,
   lecture notes, exercises, etc.).
   This author also has a lot of mathematics and computer code
   in these pages.
 o You will (of course) have full version control of the files with the
   core content and publish the latest version of all files with one command.
 o However, the web pages should appear with a prescribed look and feel
   because your host institution requires so.
 o The look and feel is automatically obtained if you write your
   web pages with particular web-based tools, but this tedious and
   boring, happens without version control, has no support for
   nicely typeset mathematics and computer code, and most
   importantly: the approach does not scale with a lot of files!
 o You would like your pages to live on a 24/7 available server *you*
   have chosen, e.g.,
   "GitHub": "http://github.com", "Bitbucket": "http://bitbucket.org",
   "Googlecode": "http://code.google.com", or similar.

In short, you would like to write something close to standard LaTeX,
but get it published on the web with your institution's look and
feel. This document tells you how to do that and minimize the fuzz
with layouts.


========= Solution =========

===== Step 1: Use DocOnce to generate text =====

We shall in this document use "DocOnce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
for writing the core text. DocOnce looks like plain text, with just a
few tags for enabling full LaTeX mathematics and nicely typeset
computer code. From DocOnce you can go to plain LaTeX, pdfLaTeX,
Sphinx, HTML, Markdown, and MediaWiki, to mention some good formats
that support LaTeX mathematics and nice computer code. (If you do not
have code and math, it is easy to go to MS Word, XML, DocBook, and
numerous other formats too.) From a DocOnce text it is also trivial
to generate slides.

===== Step 2: Write the core text =====

Write the core text, here an "exercise with some math and code":
"mydoc_plain_pygmentized.html" stored in a file `mydoc.do.txt`:

======= Solve the world's simplest differential equation =======

===== Mathematical problem =====

This exercise addresses the differential equation problem

|bt
\begin{align}
u'(t) &= -au(t), \quad t \in (0,T], label{ode}\\
u(0)  &= I,                         label{initial:value}
\end{align}
|et
where $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed constant parameters, and $u(t)$ is
the unknown function to be estimated. This mathematical model
is relevant for physical phenomena featuring exponential decay
in time.

===== Numerical solution method =====

Derive the $\theta$-rule scheme for solving (ref{ode}) numerically
with time step $\Delta t$:

|bt
\[
u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
\]
|et
Here, $n=0,1,\ldots,N-1$.

!bhint
Set up the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson (or
Midpoint) schemes first. Then generalize to the $\theta$-rule above.
!ehint

===== Implementation =====

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function
`solver` (found in the "`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" module):

|bc pycod
from numpy import linspace, zeros

def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec

===== Numerical experiments =====

Fix the values of where $I$, $a$, and $T$.
Then vary $\Delta t$ for $\theta=0,1/2,1$.
Illustrate that if $\Delta t$ is not sufficiently small,
$\theta=0$ and $\theta=1/2$ can give non-physical solutions
(more precisely, oscillating solutions).

Perform experiments and determine empirically the convergence
rate for $\theta=0,1/2,1$.

When the title in a DocOnce document (`TITLE: ...`) is missing or
commented out (`#TITLE:`), no HTML header and footer are generated,
which is important when embedding the HTML code in a template file
later.

===== Step 3: Inspect the HTML page =====

Check the default layout of your HTML page by translating the
DocOnce file to HTML:

!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc
google-chrome mydoc.html
!ec
The page is rendered with the "default HTML style": "mydoc_plain_pygmentized.html" as seen in the figure below (or "in the file itself": "mydoc_plain.html"):

===== Step 4: Find some web page and make a template =====

When you see a design of a web page that you would like to adopt,
view the source code (all browsers have a menu choice for doing this)
and store it on file. To proceed you need to know some basic HTML.

 o Identify where the main body of text is. Remove this text and
   insert `%(main)s` instead. This is a tag that will be replaced
   by the HTML code of the core text you had in `mydoc.do.txt`.
   (The HTML code of the web page is viewed as a text string in
   Python and `%(main)s` is just the standard syntax for inserting
   a dictionary with key `main` at this point.)

 o Identify the `title` tag and replace the title by `%(title)s`.
   The title (commented out) or the first heading in `mydoc.do.txt`
   will replace `%(title)s`.

 o If relevant, find the date in the page and replace by `%(date)s`.

 o Search for text `link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"...`, which
   specifies CSS stylesheets. You either need to have the stylesheet
   files together with the HTML document, or you need to copy the stylesheet
   code into the HTML file.

 o Search for text `script type="text/javascript" src="...`, which
   specifies JavaScript code. Either the code must be available on the
   net (`http://...` address) or you need a copy of this code stored
   along with the HTML file. You may use the Google Chrome or Firefox
   browsers to view the source code and just click on stylesheets,
   JavaScript files, and other links to see the content. This has the
   great advantage of showing a *complete URL* to the file that may
   have a relative path in the HTML code.

As example, we took the source code of the GitHub "minimal" theme
and implemented the points above. Some of the elements in the
downloaded page are conveniently replaced by some indicating text
that we will fill out when we finalize the layout of our web site.

!bc htmlpro
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="chrome=1">

    <title>%(title)s</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
    <meta name="viewport"
     content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <header>
        <h1>Main Permanent Header</h1>
        <p>Permanent SubHeader</p>

        <!-- picture below the heading on the left -->
	<img src="..." width=220>

      </header>

      <!-- Here goes the main page --->
      <section>

%(main)s

      </section>

      <footer>
        <p>This project is maintained by ...</p>
        <p><small>Hosted on GitHub Pages &mdash; Theme by
        <a href="https://github.com/orderedlist">orderedlist</a>
        </small></p>
      </footer>

    </div>
    <script src="js/scale.fix.js"></script>

  </body>
</html>
!ec
Note that the template requires

 * the stylesheet `styles.css` in a subdirectory `css`
 * the JavaScript `scale.fix.js` in a subdirectory `js`

We need to get our hands on both these files. For the current
application we customize the template:

 * The picture on the left is specified to `fig/discrete_function.png`
   which acts as a kind of logo for the page.
 * The  `Main Permanent Header` and `Permanent SubHeader` are
   replaced by something appropriate, here `Exercise` and
   `Differential Equations`.


===== Step 5: Embed your HTML document in the template =====

We can now use DocOnce to insert our document `mydoc.html`,
generated from `mydoc.do.txt` into an HTML template.
The template shown above, stored in the file `template_minimal.html`
is used as example. We run

!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc --html_template=template_minimal.html
!ec
The result is a file "`mydoc.html`": "mydoc_github_pygmentized.html" where

  o the first heading in `mydoc.do.txt` is substituted as title tag
  o the text in `mydoc.do.txt`, transformed to HTML, is inserted
    where `%(main)s` appears in the template.

Here is the "visual result": "mydoc_github.html":

FIGURE: [fig/github_html.png, width=900]

The original text file `mydoc.do.txt` has now been transformed
to a web page with fancy design!


======= Making a template from Vortex pages at the University of Oslo =======

As case, we invoke the page for a "course": "http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5620/h12/". The "source code": "uio/5620_pygmentized.html"
is huge. Here is a glimpse:

!bc
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/vrtx/decorating/resources/dist/style/style.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/vrtx/decorating/resources/dist/www.uio.no/logos-eng/logos.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="/vrtx/decorating/resources/dist/style/print.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="handheld" href="/vrtx/decorating/resources/dist/style/handheld.css"/>

   <script type="text/javascript" src="/vrtx/__vrtx/static-resources/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>

 ...

    <!-- Page header end -->

    <div id="uiodoc-wrapper">
    <div id="uiodoc">
        <!-- img-tag for print -->
        <img id="head-print" alt="print logo" src="/vrtx/decorating/resources/dist/www.uio.no/logos-eng/faculty-small.png"/>

...
            <div id="right-main">
              <!--startindex-->
!ec
We do the following:

 o The part of the text which we want to replace by our document must
   be deleted and substituted by `%(main)s`.
 o A more challenging task is to deal with all the links to *local files*
   of the type `/vrtx/decorating/resources/...` and similar.
   However, clicking on these links when viewing the source code of
   the page in Google Chrome or Firefox, displays the full URL
   of the files. It appears that `/vrtx/` can simply be replaced
   by `http://www.uio.no/vrtx/` and the page works (!). We therefore
   carry out that substitution.
 o The title inside the `title` tags is replaced by `%(title)s`.

(There is no date in this page and hence no need to insert `%(date)s`.)
The "resulting code": "uio/template_5620_pygmentized.hml" is ready
as a template:

!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc --html_template=mynewcoursetemplate.html
!ec
Here is "the result": "mydoc_uio.html".

FIGURE: [fig/uio_html.png, width=900]

It really looks that we are inside the Vortex web system at the
University of Oslo and all the links to *Student Life*, *People*,
etc. work.

Normally, the web pages at the University of Oslo have to be written
through a web-based editor (in the Vortex system), and the information
is stored in XML files.  It is somewhat remarkable that the HTML
rendered from these XML files can be copied so easily and used as
templates for web documents anywhere else.

======= Using the Vagrant template =======

Besides the GitHub "minimal" theme, DocOnce comes with a template
"`template_vagrant.html`":
"../../bundled/html_styles/vagrant/template_vagrant.html" adopted from
the style in the documentation of the "Vagrant":
"http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html" virtual machine
tool.

FIGURE: [fig/vagrant_web, width=900]

This template, found in
"`bundled/html_styles/style_vagrant/template_vagrant.html`":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/bundled/html_styles/style_vagrant/template_vagrant.html"
in the DocOnce source code tree, is easy to adopt to a particular set
of web pages. It looks as

FIGURE: [fig/template_vagrant, width=900]

There are several elements in the template:

 o Navigation bar to the left, which is automatically created by DocOnce.
 o A main part (`%(main)s`) and a title as usual.
 o Navigation buttons on the button, which are automatically filled in
   by DocOnce if the document is split into several parts.
 o A logo consisting of a *LogoWord* in black and a *withSubWord* in
   gray. This should be *manually edited* to some short name for the web pages
   you want to embed with the Vagrant style.
 o Navigation links in the top right part of the page. These should be
   *manually edited* or deleted.
 o At the bottom of the page there is a footer, which can be
   *manually edited* or deleted.

Here we edit the logo to *DiffEq101*, edit the navigation links at the
top right to point to Wikipedia and WolframAlpha, and insert a
copyright 2013 notice in the footer.

Translation of the original DocOnce writings in `mydoc.do.txt` is
done by

!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --html_style=bootstrap \
        --html_template=template_vagrant.html
!ec
The resulting "HTML file": "mydoc_vagrant_pygmentized.html" has
a "nice look": "mydoc_vagrant.html":

FIGURE: [fig/vagrant_html.png, width=900]

======= Summary =======

We have seen have to write web pages in a text-like format, with full
support of LaTeX mathematics and nicely typeset (pygmentized) computer code.
These pages can easily be embedded in various fancy HTML styles by
simply grabbing a web page with the desired style and editing it as
explained.

However, embedding DocOnce documents in fancy web pages is just possibility
for publishing the content. One can equally well make a traditional
LaTeX file and include the document in a book, or make a special adapted
version of the PDF for viewing on phones, or one can generate Sphinx
output which has "a lot of different nice styles": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/index.html" for viewing on the web.
