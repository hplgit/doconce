TITLE: Demonstration of features in Doconce
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula & University of Oslo
DATE: today

__Summary.__ This document demonstrates the various features that
are present in the Doconce markup language. The abstract starts
with `__Abstract.__` or `__Summary.__` in the first column and
lasts up to the table of contents or the first heading.


#Table of contents
TOC: on

======= Section heading =======

The section heading is recognized by 7 `=` characters before and after
the title, starting in the first column. There is also a chapter
heading with 9 `=`, aimed at books (LaTeX output will be the `book`
format if any chapter is present, otherwise `article`.

===== Subsection heading =====
label{subsec1}

The subsection heading has 5 `=` characters before and after the title.
A label can appear right after the heading, as in `label{mysec}`,
and we can use the label to refer to Section ref{subsec1} with
a local name.

=== Subsubsection heading ===

The subsubsection heading features 3 `=` characters and is typeset as
a separate, small heading in all formats, except LaTeX, where
a `paragraph` command is used for subsubsections.

===== Inline tagging =====

Doconce features _boldface words_, *emphasized words*, `inline verbatim
computer code` (in monospace font), [hpl: Inline comments, e.g.,
for other authors. These comments stand out and can easily be
ignore at compile time.]

!bnotice Non-breaking space character
This paragraph aims to test "non-breaking space character":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space", which is a tilde in
Doconce. A typical example where this is needed is in physical units:
7.4~km is traveled in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that
a~"link": "http://google.com"~is not broken across lines (drag the
browser window to test this).  (On the other hand, the tilde is used
in computer code, e.g., as in `[~x for x in y]` or in `y=~x`, and
should of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
!enotice

===== LaTeX mathematics =====

There is good support of LaTeX mathematics:

 * inline formulas
 * single equation without number in `equation*` or `\[ ... \]` environments
 * multiple, aligned equations using the `align` or `align*` environments

!bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f,\]
!et

or with automatic number:

!bt
\begin{equation} -\nabla^2 u = f\thinspace .\end{equation}
!et

Numbered equations (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}), with labels:

!bt
\begin{align}
F_1 &= \frac{du}{dx},
label{eq1}\\
F_2 &= \frac{dv}{dx}\thinspace .
label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et



## Markdown sections

Doconce allows simple (extended) Mardown input, such as **boldface** notation,
`inline verbatim code` in monospace font, *emphasized words*,
footnotes [^footnote], special link syntax: [link to google][1],
and code blocks,

```Python
from numpy import sin

def f(x, y):
    return sin(x + y)

print f(2, 4)
```

> Markdown also features quoted
paragraphs that start with a greater
than sign, either just in the beginning
or at every line.


# Comment lines start with # in the first column. Normally,
# a blank is inserted after the # character, but if Markdown
# is allowed as input syntax (--markdown flag), "comment lines"
# of the form "# Heading" implies a heading, not a comment.
# The remedy for confusion is to write plain comments without a
# blank after #, or rely on the fact that Markdown headings
# must have a blank line before and after, so multi-line
# comments like this work are never confused with Markdown
# headings.

## A double # implies a comment that is not copied as comment
## to the output file. Again, watch out for confusion with
## Markdown subsections. Multiple comments lines work well,
## and for single lines, drop the first blank after # or ##.

# #ifdef COMMENT
Comments can also be freely inserted inside preprocess directives
like this.
# #endif

 [^footnote]: The footnote syntax is similar to Extended Markdown
 and various email variants for simulating footnotes.
