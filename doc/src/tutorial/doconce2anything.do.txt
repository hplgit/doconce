======= From Doconce to Other Formats =======
label{doconce2formats}

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats apply the script `doconce format`:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
!ec
or just
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
!ec

===== Generating a makefile =====

Producing HTML, Sphinx, and in particular LaTeX documents from
Doconce sources requires a few commands. Often you want to
produce several different formats. The relevant commands should
then be placed in a script that acts as a "makefile".

The `doconce makefile` can be used to automatically generate
such a makefile, more precisely a Python script `make.py`, which
carries out the commands explained below. If our Doconce source
is in `main_myproj.do.txt`, we run

!bc sys
doconce makefile main_myproj html pdflatex sphinx
!ec
to produce the necessary output for generating HTML, pdfLaTeX, and
Sphinx. Usually, you need to edit `make.py` to really fit your
needs. Some examples lines are inserted as comments to show
various options that can be added to the basic commands.
A handy feature of the generated `make.py` script is that it
inserts checks for successful runs of the many `doconce` commands,
and if something goes wrong, the script aborts.


===== Preprocessing =====

The `preprocess` and `mako` programs are used to preprocess the
file, and options to `preprocess` and/or `mako` can be added after the
filename. For example,
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
!ec
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess` or `mako`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`
(for `preprocess`) or `% if FORMAT == "latex":` (for `mako`).

===== Removal of inline comments =====

The command-line arguments `--no_preprocess` and `--no_mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
!ec
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
!bc
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
!ec
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

===== Notes =====

Doconce does not have a tag for longer notes, because implementation
of a "notes feature" is so easy using the `preprocess` or `mako`
programs. Just introduce some variable, say `NOTES`, that you define
through `-DNOTES` (or not) when running `doconce format ...`. Inside
the document you place your notes between `# #ifdef NOTES` and
`# #endif` preprocess tags. Alternatively you use `% if NOTES:`
and `% endif` that `mako` will recognize. In the same way you may
encapsulate unfinished material, extra material to be removed
for readers but still nice to archive as part of the document for
future revisions.

===== Demo of different formats =====

A simple scientific report is available in "a lot of different formats":
"http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/doconce_commands.html".
How to create the different formats is explained in more depth
in the coming sections.

===== HTML =====

=== Basics ===

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
!ec
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

=== Typesetting of Code ===

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no_pygments_html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain (`pre`) HTML tags. The option `--pygments_html_linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks. A specific
Pygments style is set by `--pygments_html_style=style`, where `style`
can be `default`, `emacs`, `perldoc`, and other valid names for
Pygments styles.


=== HTML Styles ===

The HTML style can be defined either in the header of the HTML file,
using a named built-in style;
in an external CSS file; or in a template file.

An external CSS file `filename` used by setting the command-line
argument `--css=filename`. There available built-in styles are
specified as `--html_style=name`, where `name` can be

 * `solarized`: the famous "solarized": "http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized"
   style (yellowish),
 * `blueish`: a simple style with blue headings (default),
 * `blueish2`: a variant of *bluish*,
 * `bloodish`: as `bluish`, but dark read as color.

Using `--css=filename` where `filename` is a non-existing file makes
Doconce write the built-in style to that file. Otherwise the HTML
links to the CSS stylesheet in `filename`. Several stylesheets can
be specified: `--ccs=file1.css,file2.css,file3.css`.

=== HTML templates ===

Templates are HTML files with "slots" `%(main)s` for the main body
of text, `%(title)s` for the title, and `%(date)s` for the date.
Doconce comes with a few templates. The usage of templates is
described in a "separate document": "". That document describes how you your Doconce-generated
HTML file can have any specified layout.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template with your own tailored
design, see a "tutorial": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tech_wrapper.htl" on this topic. The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text. The
latter is the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, or the title (but a title is not
recommended when using templates). The date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. Doconce comes with
two templates in `bundled/html_styles`. Just copy the directory
containing the template and the CSS and JavaScript files to your
document directory, edit the template as needed (also check that
paths to the `css` and `js` subdirectories are correct - according
to how you store the template files), and run
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_template=mytemplate.html
!ec
The template in `style_vagrant` also needs an extra option
`--html_style=vagrant`. With this style, one has nice navigation buttons
that are used if the document contains `!split` commands for splitting
it into many pages.

=== The HTML File Collection ===

There are usually a range of files needed for an HTML document arising
from a Doconce source. The needed files are listed in
`.basename_html_file_collection`, where `basename` is the filestem of
the Doconce file (i.e., the Doconce source is in `basename.do.txt`).

=== Filenames ===

An HTML version of a Doconce document is often made in different styles,
calling for a need to rename the HTML output file. This is conveniently
done by the `--html_output=basename` option, where `basename` is the
filestem of the associated HTML files. The
`.basename_html_file_collection` file lists all the needed files
for the HTML document. Here is an example on making three versions of
the HTML document: `mydoc_bloodish.html`, `mydoc_solarized`, and
`mydoc_vagrant`.

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bloodish \
          --html_output=mydoc_bloodish
Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_bloodish.html
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=solarized \
          --html_output=mydoc_solarized \
          --pygments_html_style=perldoc --html_admon=apricot
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=vagrant \
          --html_output=mydoc_vagrant --pygments_html_style=default \
          --html_template=templates/my_adapted_vagrant_template.html
Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_vagrant.html
!ec

===== Blog Posts =====

Doconce can be used for writing blog posts provided the blog site accepts
raw HTML code. Google's Blogger service (`blogger.com` or
`blogname.blogspot.com`) is particularly well suited since it also
allows extensive LaTeX mathematics via MathJax.

 o Write the text of the blog post as a Doconce document without any
   title, author, and date.
 o Generate HTML as described above.
 o Copy the text and paste it into the
   text area in the blog post (just delete the HTML code that initially
   pops up in the text area). Make sure the input format is HTML.

See a "simple blog example": "http://doconce.blogspot.no" and
a "scientific report": "http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/"
for demonstrations of blog posts at `blogspot.no`.

!bwarning
In the readers' comments after the blog post one cannot paste raw HTML
code with MathJax
scripts so there is no support for mathematics in the discussion forum.
!ewarning

!bnotice
Figure files must be uploaded to some web site and the filenames name must
be replaced by the relevant URL. This can be automatically edited:

!bc shcod
cp mydoc.do.txt mydoc2.do.txt
url="https//raw.github.com/someuser/someuser.github.com"
dir="master/project/dir1/dir2"
for figname in fig1 fig2 fig3; do
  doconce replace "[$figname," "[$site/$dir/$figname.png," \
          mydoc2.do.txt
done
doconce format html mydoc2
# Paste mydoc2.html into a new blog post page
!ec
!enotice

Blog posts at Google can also be published "automatically through email":
"http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41452".
A Python program can send the contents of the HTML file
to the blog site's email address using the packages  `smtplib` and `email`.

WordPress (`wordpress.com`) allows raw HTML code in blogs,
but has very limited
LaTeX support, basically only formulas. The `--wordpress` option to
`doconce` modifies the HTML code such that all equations are typeset
in a way that is acceptable to WordPress.
Look at a "simple doconce example": "http://doconce.wordpress.com"
and a "scientific report": "http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/"
to see blog posts with mathematics and code on WordPress.

Speaking of WordPress, the related project URL:
"http://pressbooks.com" can take raw HTML code (from Doconce, for
instance) and produce very nice-looking books.  There is no support
for mathematics in the text, though.

===== Pandoc and Markdown =====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
!ec
The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
!bc sys
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
!ec
Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the "Pandoc documentation": "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"
for the many features of the `pandoc` program. The HTML output from
`pandoc` needs adjustments to provide full support for MathJax LaTeX
mathematics, and for this purpose one should use `doconce md2html`:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> doconce m2html mydoc
!ec
The result `mydoc.html` can be viewed in a browser.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS
Word.  There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your
document): `doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `doconce
md2latex` (which runs `pandoc`), or `doconce format latex`, and then
going from LaTeX to the desired format using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> doconce replace '\Verb!' '\verb!' mydoc.tex
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
!ec
When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations, `align`, or `align*`
environments are well understood for output to HTML.

Note that Doconce applies the `Verb` macro from the `fancyvrb` package
while `pandoc` only supports the standard `verb` construction for
inline verbatim text.  Moreover, quite some additional `doconce
replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed on the `.mkd` or
`.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is well translated
to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using Pandoc, it can
be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
!ec
The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

=== GitHub-flavored Markdown ===

Adding the command-line option `github-md` turns on the GutHub-flavored
Markdown dialect, which is used for the issue tracker on "GitHub": "http://github.com". A special feature is the support of task lists:
unnumbered lists with `[x]` (task done) or `[ ]` (task not done).
(Tables get typeset directly as HTML and the syntax for code highlighting
is different from Pandoc extended Markdown.) Here is an example:

!bc
|bquote
===== Problems with a function =====

There is a problem with the `f(x)` function

|bc pycod
def f(x):
    return 1 + x
|ec
This function should be quadratic.
|equote

OK, this is fixed:

|bc pycod
def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c
|ec

===== Updated task list =====

   * [x] Offer an `f(x)` function
   * [ ] Extension to cubic functions
   * [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function

=== Remaining functionality ===

|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| function | purpose                        | state |
|----l-----------l------------------------------l---------------|
|  `g(x)`  | Compute the Gaussian function. | Formula ready. |
|  `h(x)`  | Heaviside function.            | Formula ready. |
|  `I(x)`  | Indicator function.            | Nothing done yet. |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
!ec
Say this text is stored in a file `mycomments.do.txt`. Running

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mycomments --github_md
!ec
produces `mycomments.md` which can be pasted into the Write field of
the GitHub issue tracker. Turning on Preview shows the typesetting of
the quote, compute code, inline verbatim, headings, the task list, and
the table.


===== LaTeX =====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
# Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many
# formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph
# environment, as used here.

__Step 1.__ Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
!ec
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see Section ref{newcommands}).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

An option `--device=paper` makes some adjustments for documents
aimed at being printed. For example, links to web resources are
associated with a footnote listing the complete web address (URL).
(Very long URLs in footnotes can be shortened using services such
as URL: "http://goo.gl/", URL: "http://tinyurl.com/", and
URL: "https://bitly.com/".)
The default, `--device=screen`, creates a PDF file for reading
on a screen where links are just clickable.

__Step 2.__ Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
!ec
In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
!ec

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
!ec
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generated by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * `XELATEX` for processing by `xelatex`
 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font
 * `HELVETICA` for the Helvetica font
 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size
 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading PDFs on phones)
 * `MOVIE` for specifying how movies are handled: the value `media9`
   implies the `media9` package and the `\includemedia` command (default),
   while other values are `movie15` (`\includemovie` command),
   `multimedia` (for Beamer-style `\movie` command),
   or `href-run` (for the plain `\href{run:file}` command)
 * `MOVIE_CONTROLS` adds buttons for starting/stopping movies if the
   `media9` package is used.
 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere - and note that
   the preamble is only included
   if the document has a title, author, and date)
 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package for typesetting of
   code with the Pygments tool (which requires `latex`
   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)
 * `TODONOTES` for using the fancy `todonotes` package for typesetting
   inline comments (looks much like track changes in MS Word). This
   macro has only effect if inline comments are used (name, colon,
   and comment inside brackets).
 * `LINENUMBERS` for inclusion of line numbers in the text.
 * `COLORED_TABLE_ROWS` for coloring every other table rows (set this
   variable to `gray` or `blue`).
 * `BLUE_SECTION_HEADINGS` for blue section and subsection headings
 * `LATEX_HEADING` for the typesetting of the title, author, parts of
   preamble (values: `traditional` for traditional LaTeX heading,
   `titlepage` for a separate titlepage, `Springer_collection` for
   edited volumes on Springer, `beamer` for Beamer slides, `doconce_heading`
   (default) for listing institutions after names).
 * `LATEX_STYLE` for speficying the style:
   `std` for standard LaTeX, `Springer_lncse`, `Springer_T2`,
   `Springer_llncse` (the latter three are not tested).
   The style dictates the type of `documentclass` as well as inclusion of
   special packages and commands.


If you are not satisfied with the Doconce preamble, you can provide
your own preamble by adding the command-line option `--latex_preamble=myfile`.
In case `myfile` contains a documentclass definition, Doconce assumes
that the file contains the *complete* preamble you want (not that all
the packages listed in the default preamble are required and must be
present in `myfile`). Otherwise, `myfile` is assumed to contain
*additional* LaTeX code to be added to the Doconce default preamble.

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
!ec
Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. A predefined shortcut as in `shcod=Verbatim-0.85`
results in denser
vertical spacing (baselinestretch 0.85 in LaTeX terminology), and
`shcod=Verbatim-indent` implies indentation of the verbatim text.
Alternatively, one can provide all desired parameters
`\begin{Verbatim}` instruction using the syntax illustrated for
the `sys` environments above.

If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{Verbatim}`
and `\end{Verbatim}` instructions are used.


__Step 2b (optional).__ Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
You will use `doconce replace` to edit `section{` to `section*{`:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
!ec
For fixing the line break of a title, you may pick a word in the
title, say "Using", and insert a break after than word. With
`doconce subst` this is easy employing regular expressions with
a group before "Using" and a group after:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
!ec
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file so the `doconce subst` or
`doconce replace` commands can be put inside the script.

__Step 3.__ Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
!bc sys
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
!ec

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
!ec
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
!bc sys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
!ec
When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.


===== PDFLaTeX =====

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
!ec
Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally
!bc sys
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
!ec

===== XeLaTeX =====

XeLaTeX is an alternative to pdfLaTeX and is run in almost the
same way, except for the `-DXELATEX` flag to ptex2tex:

!bc
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DXELATEX
Terminal> ptex2tex -DXELATEX mydoc  # alternative
Terminal> xelatex mydoc
!ec


===== Plain ASCII Text =====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
!ec

===== reStructuredText =====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
!ec
We may now produce various other formats:
!bc sys
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
!ec

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run
!bc sys
Terminal> unoconv --show
!ec
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
!bc sys
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
!ec

__Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.__
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

 * URL:"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1033441"
 * URL:"http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html"
 * URL:"http://nileshbansal.blogspot.com/2007/12/latex-to-openofficeword.html"



===== Sphinx =====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme mydoc
!ec
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

One often just runs the simple command
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
!ec
which creates the Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  Run

!bc sys
Terminal> python automake_sphinx.py
!ec
As the output also tells, you can see the Sphinx HTML version of the document
by running

!bc sys
Terminal> google-chrome sphinx-rootdir/_build/html/index.html
!ec
or loading the `index.html` file manually into your favorite web browser.

If you cycle through editing the Doconce file and watching the
HTML output, you should observe that `automake_sphinx.py` does not
recompile the Doconce file if the Sphinx `.rst` version already exists.
In each edit-and-watch cycle do

!bc sys
Terminal> rm mydoc.rst; python automake_sphinx.py
!ec

!bnotice Tip
If you are new
to Sphinx and end up producing quite some Sphinx documents, you are encouraged
to read the Sphinx documentation and study the `automake_sphinx.py`
file. Maybe you want to do things differently.

The following paragraphs describes the many possibilities for steering
the Sphinx output.

__Links.__
The `automake_sphinx.py` script copies directories named `fig*`
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  It also examines `MOVIE:` and `FIGURE:`
commands in the Doconce file to find other image files and copies
these too. I strongly recommend to put files
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs) in
a directory named `_static`. The `automake_sphinx.py` copies
`_static*` to the Sphinx directory, which guarantees that the links
to the local files will work in the Sphinx document.

There is a utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` for checking links to
local files and moving the files to `_static` and changing the links
accordingly. For example, a link to `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` is changed
to `_static/myfile.txt` and `myfile.txt` is copied to `_static`.
However, I recommend instead that you manually copy
files to `_static` when you want to link to them, or let your
script which compiles the Doconce document do it automatically.

__Themes.__
Doconce comes with a rich collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents,
much larger than what is found in the standard Sphinx distribution.
Additional themes include
`agni`,
`basicstrap`,
`bootstrap`,
`cloud`,
`fenics`,
`fenics_minimal`,
`flask`,
`haiku`,
`impressjs`,
`jal`,
`pylons`,
`redcloud`,
`scipy_lectures`,
`slim-agogo`, and
`vlinux-theme`.

All the themes are packed out in the Sphinx directory, and the
`doconce sphinx_dir` insert lots of extra code in the `conf.py`
file to enable easy specification and customization of themes.
For example, modules are loaded for the additional themes that
come with Doconce, code is inserted to allow customization of
the look and feel of themes, etc. The `conf.py` file is a
good starting point for fine-tuning your favorite team, and your
own `conf.py` file can later be supplied and used when running
`doconce sphinx_dir`: simply add the command-line option
`conf.py=conf.py`.

A script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics`, `pyramid`, and `pylon` one writes
!bc sys
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid pylon
!ec
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!). With `make-themes.sh`
it is easy to check out various themes to find the one that is most
attractive for your document.

You may supply your own theme and avoid copying all the themes
that come with Doconce into the Sphinx directory. Just specify
`theme_dir=path` on the command line, where `path` is the relative
path to the directory containing the Sphinx theme. You must also
specify a configure file by `conf.py=path`, where `path` is the
relative path to your `conf.py` file.

__Example.__ Say you like the `scipy_lectures` theme, but you want
a table of contents to appear *to the right*, much in the same style
as in the `default` theme (where the table of contents is to the left).
You can then run `doconce sphinx_dir`, invoke a text editor with the
`conf.py` file, find the line `html_theme == 'scipy_lectures'`,
edit the following `nosidebar` to `false` and `rightsidebar` to `true`.
Alternatively, you may write a little script using `doconce replace`
to replace a portion of text in `conf.py` by a new one:

!bc shpro
doconce replace "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
    html_theme_options = {
        'nosidebar': 'true',
        'rightsidebar': 'false',
        'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
        'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
        'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
        'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
        'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
    }" "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
    html_theme_options = {
        'nosidebar': 'false',
        'rightsidebar': 'true',
        'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
        'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
        'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
        'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
        'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
    }" conf.py
!ec
Obviously, we could also have changed colors in the edit above.
The final alternative is to save the edited `conf.py` file somewhere
and reuse it the next time `doconce sphinx_dir` is run

!bc sys
doconce sphinx_dir theme=scipy_lectures \
                   conf.py=../some/path/conf.py mydoc
!ec

=== The manual Sphinx procedure ===

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

__Step 1.__ Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
!ec

__Step 2.__ Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
!bc sys
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
!ec
The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


__Step 3.__ Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
!bc sys
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
!ec
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

__Step 4.__ Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
!bc
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
!ec
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

__Step 5.__ Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
!bc sys
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
!ec

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

__Step 6.__ View the result:
!bc sys
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
!ec

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


===== Wiki Formats =====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
"Googlecode wiki": "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax",
"MediaWiki": "http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting", and
"Creole Wiki": "http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0".
These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
!ec

The produced MediaWiki can be tested in the "sandbox of
wikibooks.org": "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sandbox". The format
works well with Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and
"ShoutWiki": "http://doconcedemo.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Doconce_demo_page",
but not always well elsewhere
(see "this example":
"http://doconcedemo.jumpwiki.com/wiki/First_demo").

Large MediaWiki documents can be made with the
"Book creator":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator".
From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of "mwlib": "http://pediapress.com/code/". This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write "Wikibooks": "http://en.wikibooks.org"
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format, while
at the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book, a Sphinx web document, or a collection of HTML files.



The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

===== Google Docs =====

Google Docs are normally made online in the interactive editor. However,
you may upload a Doconce document to Google Docs. This requires transforming
the Doconce document to one of the accepted formats for Google Docs:

 * OpenOffice: `doconce format rst` and then run
   `rst2odt` (or `rst2odt.py`). Upload the `.odt` file, click
   *Open...* in Google Drive and choose *Google Docs* as viewer.
 * MS Word: `doconce format pandoc` and then run `pandoc` to
   produce a `.docx` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive
   and opened in Google Docs.
 * RTF: `doconce format pandoc` and then run `pandoc` to produce
   a `.rtf` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive and opened.
   Another possibility is to run `doconce format latex` and
   then "latex2rtf": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf"
   (the support of mathematics has gotten worse).
 * Plain text: `doconce format plain`. Upload the `.txt` file
   to Google Drive and open in Google Docs.
 * HTML: `doconce format html`. Upload the `.html` file and
   open in Google Docs. Complicated HTML files can be misinterpreted
   by Google Docs.

This is not yet much tested. It remains to see how code becomes in
Google Docs. Support for mathematics is probably impossible until
Google Docs can import LaTeX files, but LaTeX mathematics can be embedded
in Google Docs and the "googledoc2latex": "http://code.google.com/p/googledoc2latex" script can convert a Google document to LaTeX.

===== Tweaking the Doconce Output =====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.
