TITLE: DocOnce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today


 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like "LaTeX":"http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf", "HTML":"http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/", "reStructuredText":"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html", "Sphinx":"http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html", and "wiki":"http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax"? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


======= Some DocOnce Features =======

 * Strong support for texts with much math and code.

 * Same source can produce a variety of output formats.
   The following support LaTeX math and (pygmentized) code:

   * "traditional LaTeX B/W documents for printing": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_4printing.pdf"
   * "color LaTeX PDF documents": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.pdf"
   * "color LaTeX PDF documents for viewing on small phones": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_4phone.pdf"
   * "Sphinx HTML documents with 20+ different designs": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/sphinx-fenics_minimal/report.html"
   * "Plain HTML": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.html", "Boostrap HTML": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_bootstrap_bluegray.html", or with a "template": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_vagrant.html", or with "another template": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_github_minimal.html", or "solarized": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_solarized3_light.html"
   * HTML for "Google": "http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/" or "Wordpress": "http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/" blog posts
   * "MediaWiki": "http://doconcedemo.shoutwiki.com/wiki/DocOnce_demo_page" (Wikipedia, Wikibooks, etc)
   * Markdown
   * IPython notebook

   Other formats include plain untagged text (for email),
   Creole wiki (for Bitbucket wikis), Google wiki (for Googlecode),
   reStructuredText, and Epytext.

 * Integration with Mako enables use of variables, functions, if-tests,
   and loops to parameterize the text and generate various versions of
   the text for different purposes.

 * Computer code can be copied directly from parts of source code files.

 * Running text can quickly be edited to slide formats (reveal.js and deck.js,
   based on HTML5+CSS3).

 * Special exercise environments with support for hints, answers,
   subexercises, etc.

 * Automatic inline embedding of YouTube and Vimeo movies.

 * Good support for admonitions in various LaTeX and HTML styles
   for warnings, questions, hints, remarks, summaries, etc.


======= What Does DocOnce Look Like? =======

DocOnce text looks like ordinary text (much like Markdown[^markdown-input]),
but there
are some almost invisible text constructions that allow you to control
the formating. Here are some examples.

  * Bullet lists automatically arise from lines starting with `*`,
    or `o` if the list is to be enumerated.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by `*`. _Words in boldface_
    are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in backticks and
    then typeset `verbatim (in a monospace font)`.

  * Section and paragraph headings are recognied special
    decorating characters (`=` or `_`) before and after the heading.
    The length of the decoration determines the level of the
    section.

  * Blocks of computer code are included by surrounding the blocks with
    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) tags on separate lines.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are included by surrounding the blocks
    with `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) tags on separate lines.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics
    such that formulas make sense also when not rendered by LaTeX
    or MathJax.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
    YouTube and Vimeo videos are automatically embedded in web documents.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Special comment lines are not visible in the output.

  * Comments to authors can be inserted throughout the text and
    made visible or invisible as desired.

  * There is an exercise environment with many advanced features.

  * With a preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include other
    documents (files), large portions of text can be defined in or out
    of the text, and tailored format-specific constructs can easily be
    included. With Mako a single text can output its program examples
    in two or more languages.

[^markdown-input]: In fact, DocOnce allows basic
"GitHub/extended Markdown syntax": "https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" as input. This is attractive for newcomers from Markdown or
writers who also write Markdown documents (or uses Markdown frequently at
GitHub).

===== What Can DocOnce Be Used For? =====

LaTeX is ideal for articles, thesis, and books, but not so suited
for web documents. Nice environments for web documents, such as
Sphinx, Markdown, or plain HTML, are not particularly well
suited for thesis and books. IPython notebooks are ideal for
documenting computational experiments, but do not (yet) meet the
requirements of books and thesis.

What about migrating a part of a book to blog posts? What about making
an MS Word version of parts or an untagged text for inclusion in
email?  What about efficiently generating slides in modern HTML5
style?  DocOnce enables all this with just *one source* (the slogan is
*document once - include anywhere*).
DocOnce also
has many extra features for supporting documents with much code and
mathematics, not found in any of the mentioned formats.

===== Basic Syntax =====

Here is an example of some simple text written in the DocOnce format:

!bc
======= First a Section Heading =======

Section headings have 7 equality characters before and after the heading.
With 9 characters we have a chapter heading, 5 gives a subsection
heading, and 3 a subsubsection heading.

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, but must always start at the
beginning of lines. Tags used for _boldface_ words, *emphasized*
words, and `computer` words look natural in plain text.  Quotations
appear inside double backticks and double single quotes, as in ``this
example''.

Below the section title we have a *label*, which can be used to
refer to Section ref{my:first:sec}.
References to equations, such as (ref{myeq1}), work in the same
LaTeX-inspired way.

Lists are typeset as you would do in email,

  * item 1
  * item 2,
    perhaps with a 2nd line
  * item 3

Note the consistent use of indentation (as in Python programming!).
Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

__Hyperlinks.__ Paragraph headings are surrounded by double underscores.
URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL": "tutorial.do.txt". DocOnce distinguishes between paper
and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.

__Inline comments.__
DocOnce also allows inline comments of the form [name: comment] (with
a space after `name:`), e.g., such as [hpl: here I will make some
remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
by a command-line argument (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an
example).

__Footnotes.__ Adding a footnote[^footnote] is also possible.

[^footnote]: The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.

__Tables.__
Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
!ec
The DocOnce text above results in the following little document:


======= First a Section Heading =======

Section headings have 7 equality characters before and after the heading.
With 9 characters we have a chapter heading, 5 gives a subsection
heading, and 3 a subsubsection heading.

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, but must always start at the
beginning of lines. Tags used for _boldface_ words, *emphasized*
words, and `computer` words look natural in plain text.  Quotations
appear inside double backticks and double single quotes, as in ``this
example''.

Below the section title we have a *label*, which can be used to
refer to Section ref{my:first:sec}.
References to equations, such as (ref{myeq1}), work in the same
LaTeX-inspired way.

Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2,
    perhaps with a 2nd line
  * item 3

Note the consistent use of indentation (as in Python programming!).

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

__Hyperlinks.__ Paragraph headings are surrounded by double underscores.
URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL": "tutorial.do.txt". DocOnce distinguishes between paper
and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.

__Inline comments.__
DocOnce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example). Ordinary comment
lines start with `#` and are copied to comment lines in the
output format.

__Footnotes.__
Adding a footnote[^footnote] is also possible.

[^footnote]: The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.

__Tables.__
Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== Mathematics and Computer Code =====

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in formats
not supporting LaTeX mathematics
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$ is
typeset as

!bc
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
!ec
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula. If you write a lot of mathematics, only the
output formats `latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`, `sphinx`, and `pandoc`
are of interest
and all these support inline LaTeX mathematics so then you will naturally
drop the pipe symbol and write just

!bc
$\nu = \sin(x)$
!ec
However, if you want more textual formats, like plain text or reStructuredText,
the text after the pipe symbol may help to make the math formula more readable
if there are backslahes or other special LaTeX symbols in the LaTeX code.

Blocks of mathematics are typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin TeX, end TeX) instructions:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
|et
!ec
## Note: |bt and |et (and |bc and |ec below) are used to illustrate
## tex and code blocks in inside verbatim blocks and are replaced
## by !bt, !et, !bc, and !ec after all other formatting is finished.
## (Comment lines starting with ## are not copied to the output
## format and hence much used to explain the DocOnce syntax
## used in special constructions.)
The result looks like this:

!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
!et
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics
(this includes `latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`, `sphinx`, `ipynb`, `pandoc`,
and `mwiki`). Simpler
formats have to just list the raw
LaTeX syntax.

LaTeX writers who adopt DocOnce need to pay attention to the following:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the `html`, `sphinx`,
   and `ipynb` formats.
 * Only five equation environments can be used: `\[ ... \]`,
   `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, and `align`.
 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   `newcommands*.tex`.
 * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

!bwarning Remark
Although DocOnce allows user-defined styles in the preamble of LaTeX output,
HTML-based output cannot make use of such styles. If-else constructs for
the preprocessor can be used to allow special LaTeX environments for
LaTeX output and alternative typesetting for other formats, but it is
recommended to stay away from special environments in the text and
write in a simpler fashion. For example, DocOnce has no special construction
for algorithms, so these must be simulated by lists or verbatim blocks.
Other constructions that should be avoided include margin notes, special
tables, and
`subfigure` (combine image files to one file instead, via `doconce combine_images`).
!ewarning

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively.

!bc
|bc pycod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
|ec
!ec
Such blocks are formatted as

!bc pycod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
!ec
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to `sphinx`, `rst`, and formats close to plain text),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!).

Another document can be included by writing `# #include "mynote.do.txt"`
at the beginning of a line.  DocOnce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you
plain text editing capabilities.


===== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography =====
label{newcommands}

DocOnce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands are defined in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`, using standard LaTeX syntax. Only newcommands
for use inside math environments are supported.

Labels, corss-references, citations, and support of an index and
bibliography are much inspired by LaTeX syntax, but DocOnce features
no backslashes. Use labels for sections and equations only, and
preceed the reference by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of
an equation, surround the reference by parenthesis.

Here is an example:

!bc
===== My Section =====
label{sec:mysec}

idx{key equation} idx{$\u$ conservation}

We refer to Section ref{sec:yoursec} for background material on
the *key equation*. Here we focus on the extension

# \Ddt, \u and \mycommand are defined in newcommands_keep.tex

|bt
\begin{equation}
\Ddt{\u} = \mycommand{v},
label{mysec:eq:Dudt}
\end{equation}
|et
where $\Ddt{\u}$ is the material derivative of $\u$.
Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important in a number
of contexts, see cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.

As see in Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig}, the key equation
features large, smooth regions *and* abrupt changes.

FIGURE: [fig/myfile, width=600 frac=0.9] My figure. label{mysec:fig:myfig}

===== References =====

BIBFILE: papers.pub
!ec

For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file
in the DocOnce source and a "Sphinx version": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/" of this document.


## Example on including another DocOnce file (using preprocess):

# #include "doconce2anything.do.txt"


===== Demos =====

The current text is generated from a DocOnce format stored in the file
!bc
doc/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
DocOnce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how DocOnce is used in a real case.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

# #include "../manual/install.do.txt"
