======= DocOnce: example on slide code with cells =======

One can introduce a table-like layout with MxN cells and
put slide elements in various cell. A cell with position
MN is surrounded by `!bslidecell MN` and `!eslidecell`
tags. Below is an example with a bullet list to the left and
a figure to the right (two cells, numbered 00 and 01).

======= Headline =======

!bslidecell 00
 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2
 * Key point 3 takes very much more text to explain because
   this point is really comprehensive, and although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes

!bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

!bpop
$\theta=0$: Forward Euler, $\theta=1$: Backward Euler,
$\theta=1/2$: Crank-Nicolson
