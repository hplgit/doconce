======= Scope =======

  * Focus: documents with color{red}{much} *math* and *computer code*
  * Key question: What tools should I use for writing?
  * Default answer: LaTeX
  * Recent popular alternative tools: HTML w/MathJax,
    Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki, IPython notebook

======= Fundamental question =======

When I write some scientific material,

 * a LaTeX document,
 * a blogg (HTML),
 * some web pages (HTML),
 * a Sphinx document,
 * some Markdown files,

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

!bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)
!epop

!split
======= Popular tools anno 2013 and their math support =======

!bpop
 * _LaTeX_: de facto standard for math-instensive documents
 * _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_, _LuaLaTeX_: takes over (figures in png, pdf)
 * _MS Word_: too clicky math support and ugly fonts, but much used
 * _HTML with MathJax_: "full" LaTeX *math*, but too much tagging
 * _Sphinx_:
   somewhat limited LaTeX math support, but great support for web design
 * _reStructuredText_: no math support, but transforms to
   lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _Markdown_: somewhat limited LaTeX math support, but minor tagging,
   transforms to lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _IPython notebooks_: Markdown code/math,
   combines Python code, interactivity, and
   visualization
 * _MediaWiki_: quite good LaTeX math support (cf. Wikipedia)
 * Other _wiki_ formats: no math support, great for collaborative editing
 * _Wordpress_: supports LaTeX *formulas* only, but good blogging support
 * _Google blogger_: supports full HTML with MathJax
 * _Epydoc_: old tool for Python code documentation
 * _Plain text for email_: no math, just raw LaTeX, and no tagging
!epop

!split

======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support much less =======

 * LaTeX inline math: works with all (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki)
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support much less =======

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX, raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; inline tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Page references: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but not on paper!)
!epop

!bpop
Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.
!epop

!split
======= Concerns I =======

!bpop
 * Sphinx refers to figures by the caption (has to be short!) and
   strips away any math notation (avoid that!).
 * Sphinx refers to sections by the title, but removes math in the
   reference, so avoid math in headlines.
 * Tables cannot be referred to by numbers and have to appear at
   fixed positions in the text.
 * Computer code has to appear at fixed positions in the text.
 * Algorithms must be written up using basic elements like lists or
   paragraphs with headings.
 * Recipes are often typeset as enumerated lists. For recipes with
   code or math blocks: drop the list (gives problems in some formats)
   and use paragraph (or subsubsection) headings with "Step 1.",
   "Step 2.", etc.
!epop

!split
======= Concerns II =======

!bpop
 * Footnotes must appear as part of the running text (e.g., sentences
   surrounded by parenthesis), since only a few formats support footnotes.
 * Sphinx does not handle code blocks where the first line is indented.
 * Multiple plots in the same figure: mount the plots to one image
   file and include this (`montage` for png, gif, jpeg; `pdftk`, `pdfnup`,
   and `pdfcrop` for PDF).
 * If you need several equations *numbered* in an `align` environment,
   recall that Sphinx, Markdown, and MediaWiki cannot handle this,
   although they have LaTeX math support.
 * Markdown tolerates labels in equations but cannot refer to them.
!epop

# Not valid anymore:
# Keys for items in the bibliography are made visible by Sphinx so
#   "bibitems" a la BibTeX must look sensible and consistent.

!split
======= Concerns III =======

!bpop
 * Index words can appear anywhere in LaTeX, but should be outside
   paragraphs in other tools.
 * References to tables, program code and algorithms can only be
   made in LaTeX.
 * Figures are floating in LaTeX, but fixed in other tools, so place
   figures exactly where they are needed the first time.
 * Curve plots with color lines do not work well in black-and-white
   printing. Make sure plots makes sense in color and BW (e.g., by
   using colors *and* markers).
!epop

!split
======= Solution I: Use a format that translates to many =======

 * Sphinx can do nice HTML, LaTeX, epub, (almost) plain text,
   man pages, Gnome devhelp files, Qt help files, texinfo, JSON
 * Markdown can do LaTeX, HTML, MS Word, OpenOffice, XML,
   reStructuredText, epub, DocBook, ... but not Sphinx
 * IPython notebook: can do LaTeX, reStructuredText, HTML, PDF,
   Python script
 * Sphinx and Markdown has some limited math support

!split
======= Solution II: Use Doconce =======

Doconce offers minimalistic typing, great flexibility wrt format,
especially for scientific writing with much math and code.

 * Can generate LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki, Google wiki,
   Creole wiki, reST, plain text
 * Made for large science books *and* small notes
 * Targets books, electronic PDF, PDF for phones,
   designed web pages, blog posts
 * Many special features (code snippets from files, embedded movies,
   admonitions, ...)
 * Very effective for generating slides from ordinary text
 * Applies Mako: Doconce text is a program (!)
 * Less tagged than LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx

!bc
# Insert index items in the source
idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).

# Make hyperlink
"some link text": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"

# Hyperlink with complete URL as link text

Figures with HTML and LaTeX size info, and caption: *everything on one line*
!enotice

!bc

Movies are also supported:

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]
!ec
and rendered as

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

!split
======= Math =======

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.


An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags,
the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
which is rendered as

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
!et

!split
======= Math flexibility =======

Limit math environments to

!bc
\[ ... \]

\begin{equation*}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
\end{align}
!ec

Even though Sphinx, Markdown, and MediaWiki have problems with
the latter, Doconce splits it into separate, single equations
such that align with labels works accross formats.

!split
======= Displaying code =======

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags:

!bc
|bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt); N = int(round(T/dt)); T = N*dt
    u = zeros(N+1); t = linspace(0, T, N+1)

    u[0] = I
    for n in range(0, N):
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec
!ec
This gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt); N = int(round(T/dt)); T = N*dt
    u = zeros(N+1); t = linspace(0, T, N+1)

    u[0] = I
    for n in range(0, N):
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

`pycod`: Python snippet, `pypro`: complete Python program;
`fcod/fpro`: Fortran; `ccod/cpro`: C, `mcod/mpro`: Matlab, etc.


!split
======= Copying code from source files =======

We recommend to copy as much code as possible directly from the
source files:

!bc
@@@CODE path/to/file
@@@CODE path/to/file   fromto: start-regex@end-regex
!ec
For example, copying a code snippet starting with `def solver(` and
ending with (line not included) `def next(x, y,` is specified by
start and end regular expressions:

!bc
@@@CODE src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver\(@def next\(x,\s*y,
!ec

Typesetting of code is implied by the file extension:

 * `.py`: `pypro` if complete file, `pycod` if snippet
 * `.pyopt`: visualized execution via the "Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com"
 * `.f`, `.f90`, `f.95`: `fpro` and `fcod`
 * `.cpp`, `.cxx`: `cpppro` and `cppcod`
 * `.c`: `cpro` and `ccod`
 * `.*sh`: `shpro` and `shcod`
 * `.m`: `mpro` and `mcod`
 * `ptex2tex`: between 40+ code styles in LaTeX
 * `pygments` is used for code in HTML (ca 10 styles)

!split
======= Demonstrating code execution =======
label{slide:pot}

With `!bc pyoptpro` or a file `*.pyopt`, the code applies the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com" for displaying
program flow and state of variables:

@@@CODE src/dc_mod.pyopt


!split
======= Tables =======

  |--------------------------------|


!split
======= Newcommands for math =======

 * `newcommands*.tex` files contain newcommands
 * Used directly in LaTeX
 * Substitution made for many other formats

!split
======= Labels, citations, index, bibliography =======

Lables, citations, index, and bibliography follow the ideas of
LaTeX, but without backslashes:

!bc
===== My Section =====
label{sec:mysec}

## idx{keyword} is used to add keyword to the index
idx{key equation} idx{$\u$ conservation}

We refer to Section ref{sec:yoursec} for background material on
the *key equation*. Here we focus on the extension

## \Ddt, \u and \mycommand are defined in newcommands_keep.tex

|bt
\begin{equation}
\Ddt{\u} = \mycommand{v} label{mysec:eq:Dudt}
\end{equation}
|et
Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important, see
cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.

Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig} displays the features.

FIGURE: [fig/myfile, width=600] My figure. label{mysec:fig:myfig}

===== References =====

BIBFILE: papers.pub
!ec
The `papers.pub` file must be in "Publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish"
format (easy to make from BibTeX).

!split
======= Exercises =======

Doconce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:

!bc
===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1}
files=flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions=mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py
keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

|bsubex
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.

|bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Compute the probability of getting heads.

======= Exercises =======

All *exercises*, *problems*, and *projects* in a document are parsed
and available in a data structure (list of dicts) for further
processing (e.g., making a book of problems).

!bc

             'text': 'Make a program that simulates ...'},],
  'title': 'Flip a Coin',
  'type': 'Problem'}]
!ec

!split
======= Use of preprocessors =======

 * Simple if-else tests a la C preprocessor
 * `FORMAT` variable can be used to test on format
    * if latex/pdflatex do one sort of code (raw LaTeX)
    * if html, do another type of code (raw HTML)
 * Easy to comment out large portions of text
 * Easy to make different versions of the document
 * The mako preprocessor is really powerful - gives a
   complete programming language inside the document!


!split
======= Doconce admonitions =======

!bwarning Use with caution!
Such environments may light up the document, but can be disturbing too.
!ewarning

!bnotice Going deeper.
More details can be separated from the rest.
!enotice

!bquestion Time for review!
  * Maybe ask a question?
  * Or two?
!equestion

!bblock Conclusions
  * A special "block" admonition has less pronounced typesetting and
    can be used when no special icon is desired. Good for slides.
!eblock

!split
======= Slides =======

Very effective way to generate slides from running text:

 * Take a copy of your Doconce prose
 * Strip off as much text as possible
 * Emphasize key points in bullet items
 * Focus on figures and movies
 * Focus on key equations
 * Focus on key code snippets
 * Insert `!split` wherever you want a new slide to
   begin
 * Insert `!bpop` and `!epop` around elements to pop up
   in sequence
 * Use 7 `=` or 5 `=` in headings (H2 or H3)
 * Slides are made with HTML5 tools such as reveal.js, deck.js,
   csss, or dzslides

!split
======= Example on slide code =======

!bc
!split
======= Headline =======

 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2
 * Key point 3: Although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes to investigate
   what happens with the slide layout where there is
   so much text under one point

FIGURE: [fig/teacher1, width=100 frac=0.5]

======= Slide styles =======

!bpop
 * Supported HTML5 packages:
   * "reveal.js": "http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/"
   * "deck.js": "http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/"
   * "dzslides": "http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/"
   * "csss": "http://leaverou.github.com/csss/#intro"
 * _Problem_: each package has its own syntax (though similar)
   * _Solution_: slide code is autogenerated from Doconce
 * _Problem_: reveal and deck have numerous styles
   * _Solution_: easy "to autogenerate all styles": "demo/index.html" for a talk
 * _Problem_: HTML5 slides need many style files
   * _Solution_: autocopy all files to talk directory
 * _Problem_: original versions of the styles have too large fonts,
   centering, and other features not so suitable for lectures

======= Output in HTML =======

Run in terminal window:
!bc
doconce format html doconcefile

# Solarized HTML style
doconce format html doconcefile --html_solarized

# Control pygments typesetting of code
doconce format html doconcefile --pygments_html_style=native

# Or use plain <pre> tag for code
doconce format html doconcefile --no_pygments_html

# Further making of slides
doconce slides_html doconcefile reveal --html_slide_theme=darkgray

======= Output for blogging =======

Two types of blogs are supported:

 * Google's "blogspot.com": "http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/":
   just paste the raw HTML (full support of math and code)
 * "Wordpress": "http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/":
   despite limited math, Doconce manipulates the math
   such that even `equation` and `align` work in Wordpress :-)

For wordpress, add `--wordpress`:
!bc
doconce format html doconcefile --wordpress
!ec
and paste the code into the text area.



!split
======= Output in pdfLaTeX =======

!bc
doconce format pdflatex doconcefile

# Result: doconcefile.p.tex (ptex2tex file)
# Run either
ptex2tex doconcefile
# or
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile -DHELVETICA envir=minted

pdflatex doconcefile
bibtex doconcefile
pdflatex doconcefile

# More control of how code is typeset
doconce format pdflatex doconcefile --minted_latex_style=trac
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile envir=minted

doconce format pdflatex doconcefile
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile envir=ans:nt
!ec

!split
======= Output in Sphinx =======

!bc
doconce format sphinx doconcefile

# Autocreate sphinx directory
doconce sphinx_dir theme=pyramid doconcefile

# Copy files and build HTML document
python automake-sphinx.py

google-chrome sphinx-rootdir/_build/html/index.html
!ec

Much easier than running the Sphinx tools manually!

======= Installation =======

 * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python-doconce` (old!)
 * Source at "GitHub": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" (recommended!)
   * `hg clone` + `sudo python setyp.py install`
 * Many "dependencies...": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies"
   * Must have `preprocess` and `mako`
   * Need `latex`, `sphinx`, `pandoc`, etc. (see the "Installation": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies" description)
   * Easy for slides: only `preprocess` is needed :-)

======= Writing tips for LaTeX writers who want to convert to Doconce  =======

 * `doconce latex2doconce` helps the translation
 * Use `\[ \]`, `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, `align*` and nothing more for
   equations
 * Figures: avoid subfigures (combine image files instead), use `\includegraphics`, have captions after graphics, use short figure captions, position exactly where needed
 * Tables: have them inline (not floating), with no caption
 * Computer codes: have them inline (not floating)
 * Avoid footnotes, `pageref`
 * Do not use *algorithm* environments, use simple list formatting instead
 * Avoid math in section headings
 * Use `pdflatex` or `xetex`
 * Use BibTeX (can easily be converted to "publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" used by Doconce)
 * Use `\href` for links (and insert links frequently)
 * Use the `bm` package for boldface $\bm{u}$
 * Place all newcommands in a separate file, with one definition per line
   (multiline definitions goes to a separate LaTeX preamble file in Doconce)
 * Avoid all fancy LaTeX constructs - more backslashes than needed in math
   and sections is a bad thing...

======= Doconce writing tips =======

# * See the previous *Concerns I, II and III* slides for issues when writing
#   for multiple formats. However: Doconce makes a fix so that Sphinx and
#   other formats works with labels in align environments :-)

Figures:

 * Prepare figures in the right format: EPS for `latex`, PDF for `pdflatex`,
   PNG, GIF or JPEG for HTML formats (`html`, and HTML output from
   `sphinx`, `rst`, `pandoc`). One can omit the figure file extension and
   `doconce` will pick the most appropriate file for the given output format.
 * Let plotting programs produce both PDF/EPS and PNG files.
   (Recall that PDF and EPS are vector graphics formats that can scale to
   any size with much higher quality than PNG or other bitmap formats.)
 * Use `doconce combine_images` to combine several images into one.

!split
======= Doconce writing tips =======

 * `\bm{u}` gives nicer boldface typesetting of math symbols than
   the alternatives `\boldsymbol{u}` and `\pmb{u}`.
 * For HTML-based formats using MathJax, `\bm{u}` is not supported
   and therefore automatically replaced by `\boldsymbol{u}` by Doconce.
 * Use `\color{blue}{formula}` in math expressions to color a part.
 * Not all LaTeX math is supported by MathJax. Some legal LaTeX math
   might give MathJax problems - then one has to rewrite the expression
   to find a syntax that works both with LaTeX and MathJax.
 * Use `doconce spellcheck *.do.txt` to automatically spellcheck files.
 * Avoid page references and footnotes.

======= Writing tips for sphinx and other formats =======

For output formats different from `latex`, `pdflatex`, and `html`:

 * Use labels only right after section headings and in equations.
 * Be careful with labels in `align` math environments: `pandoc`
   and `mwiki` cannot refer to them.
 * `sphinx` output requires
   * no math in section headings or figure captions
     (gets removed in references)
   * running text to start in column 1
   * progressive section headings: after chapter (9 `=`) comes
     section (7 `=`), then subsection (5 `=`), then paragraph
     (3 `=`).
   * index entries (`idx{keyword}`) before the paragraph where they
     are introduced (before 3 `=` too)
   * a line of text and no comment before code or list
