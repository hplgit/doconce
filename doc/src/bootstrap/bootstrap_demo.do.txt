TITLE: Doconce Demo of the Bootstrap style

Doconce supports a variety of Bootstrap styles in a simple
way:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bootswatch --html_admon=bootstrap_panel
!ec

The title, optionally with authors, date, table of contents, abstract
and/or a short introduction is typeset using the Jumbotron environment
from Bootstrap.  If a `!split` command is used before the first
section heading, a button with `Read...` and a link to the next page
is inserted if the document is split using `doconce split_html`.  This
construction results in a short, standard Bootstrap main page.

# A split before the first section will enable a button in the jumbotron
# for going to the first real page

!split

======= Themes =======

Doconce supports the following themes from the Bootstrap family:

 * `bootstrap` (the original "Bootstrap theme": "http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/")
 * `bootswatch`, defaults to the Bootswatch Cosmo theme
 * `bootswatch_THEME`, where `THEME` can be among
   (see "demos": "http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/?theme=5#bootswatch_tab")
   * Bootswatch themes with white background:
     * `cerulean`
     * `cosmo`
     * `flatly`
     * `journal`
     * `lumen`
     * `readable`
     * `simplex`
     * `spacelab`
     * `united`
     * `yeti`
   * Bootswatch themes with dark background:
     * `amelia`
     * `cyborg`
     * `darkly`
     * `slate`
     * `superhero`
 * Variations of the Bootstrap theme, named `bootstrap_THEME`, where
   `THEME` can be
   * `FlatUI` for the "Flat UI": "http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/" theme
   * `bootflat` for the "Bootflat": "http://bootflat.github.io/" theme
   * `blue`, `red`, `brown`, `bluegray`, and `bloodish` color variations
     of the original Bootstrap theme

You write Boostrap HTML files as normal Doconce documents, but there
are some additional features:

 * Highlighted intro with big title, optionally author(s), date,
   intro/abstract, and an optional button for reading more (on the
   next page.
 * Possibility to define a local grid of elements in the document to
   align admons, figures, code, or other elements horisontally.
 * Other layouts of admons [^admons].
 * Footnotes feature a tooltip functionality such that hovering the mouse
   over the footnote brings up a little window with the footnote
   (try it on the footnote after *admon* right above!).

!bnotice Quick generation of websites
To make a typical website with Bootstrap layout and different type of
pages for different things, just

 * write a main document in Doconce, insert a `!split` before the first section
 * write other documents and store their HTML versions in subdirectory `static_*`
 * link the documents (locally) to each other (link directly to the HTML
   version in `static_*`)
!enotice

[^admons]: ``Admon'' is a short form for admonition: a
box that highlights some text, e.g., as extra material or as
particularly important material. Doconce supports different types
of admonitions: notice, question, summary, and warning. These
can have an optional title, and some admonition styles will also
include an icon image. In addition, there is a block admonition
without any icon, but with an optional title.


======= Demonstrations of admons =======

The Bootstrap/Bootswatch styles support two kinds of admons:

 * alert admons (`bootstrap_alert`) with colored background (default)
 * panel admon (`bootstrap_panel`) where only the title has colored background

Typical commands for producing Boostrap or Bootswatch layouts are

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=boostrap
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=booswatch
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=boostrap --admon_style=bootstrap_panel
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=booswatch_superhero --admon_style=bootstrap_panel
!ec

Below are some examples on admons.

This is the admon for warnings or paying attention.

!bquestion
How many admon styles are supported by the Doconce Boostrap and Bootswatch
styles?
!equestion

!bsummary
Doconce supports the following elements of Bootstrap elements:

 * Admons
 * Panels (via admons)
 * Jumbotron for title and intro
 * Columns of content (grid structure via the `slidecell` environment)
 * Tooltips via footnotes
!esummary

Tables often get a fancy typesetting:

|-l----r-------r--------r--|
|$i$|$h_i$|$\bar T_i$|`L_i`|
|-l-----r-------r----r-----|
|0   |0     |288   |-0.0065|
|1   |11,000|216   |0.0	   |
|2   |20,000|216   |0.001  |
|3   |32,000|228   |0.0028 |
|4   |47,000|270   |0.0	   |
|5   |51,000|270   |-0.0028|
|6   |71,000|214   |`NaN`  |

===== Principles of grid structures =====

The HTML page can feature a grid structure of cells, defined by
the following syntax in case of a 1x3 grid:

!bc
# begin-grid-area

|bslidecell 00
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 01
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 02
...
|eslidecell

# end-grid-area
!ec

!bwarning Important rule
 * The `# begin/end-grid-area` directives mark the beginning and end of
   a region where we can have horizontal elements stacked in a grid.
 * Only text *inside* the slidecell environments is typeset in the output HTML
   document.
!ewarning

For example, the mathematics in the following 2x2 grid structure will
be lost because it appears outside the slidecell environments:

!bc
# begin-grid-area

|bslidecell 00
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 01
...
|eslidecell

We consider

|bt
\[ f(x, y) = \sin (x + y) \]
|et

|bslidecell 10
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 11
...
|eslidecell

# end-grid-area
!ec


!bnotice It is easy to shuffle cells around in the grid structure.
A nice feature is that the coordinates of the cells, here `00`, `01`,
and `02` can be given in any desired order. For example, if we want
to reverse the sequence of the three elements in the three columns
of this grid, we simply change `00` by `02` and `02` by `00`.
