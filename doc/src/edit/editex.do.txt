TITLE: Test of editing markup
AUTHOR: HPL
DATE: today

__Summary.__ In this mini article we demonstrate the editing
markup in DocOnce. This allows highlighting of corrections in
a text.

======= A math story =======

Given $f(x)$. We seek the roots of $f$ i.e. the $x$ values for which
$f(x)=0$. The most famous method is Newton's method:

!bt
\[ x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f'(x_k)}{f(x_k)},\quad k=0,1,\ldots \]
!et
It needs $x_0$. In theory this method has quadratic convergence,
however it requires $x_0$ to be close to a root.

!bwarning Problems with the text above
Readers will normally find problems with the text above and a desire
to edit. DocOnce features a syntax for editing running text.
This syntax is demonstrated below. Edit markup is not allowed
in math blocks, code blocks, or section headings.

We now want to annotate this text with edit markup. Such markup
has the syntax of *inline comments*, which are comments inside
square brackets with an identifier and the comment text:

!bc
[identifier: some text]
!ec
The identifier can be a name (to recognize the reader who provided
the comment), but in edit markup it is usually either `add`, `del`,
or `edit`. The edit markup consists of

!bc
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
!ec
In addition, one may provide an ordinary inline comment a la

!bc
[edit: change the title to *Root finding*.]
!ec

Below is the text with edit markup, followed by the rendering of
this markup.

__Summary.__ In this [del: mini] article[add: ,] we demonstrate
the editing markup in DocOnce[edit: . This -> which] allows
highlighting of corrections [add: via colors] in a text.

======= A math story =======

[edit: change heading to *Root finding*]

Given [add: a function] $f(x)$. We seek the roots of $f$[add:,]
i.e.[add:,] the $x$ values for which $f(x)=0$. [edit: The most ->
A] famous [add: iterative solution] method is Newton's method:

!bt
\[ x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f'(x_k)}{f(x_k)},\quad k=0,1,\ldots \]
!et
[edit: error in right-hand side, the fraction $\frac{f'(x_k)}{f(x_k)}$
must be $\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$.]
[edit: It needs $x_0$ -> A start value $x_0$ is required].
In theory[add:,] this method has quadratic
convergence[del:,][add:.] [edit: h -> H]owever[add:,]
[edit: it -> the result] requires $x_0$ to be close to a root.

To remove the edit markup and implement their implications, run

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec
if the name of the DocOnce source file is `mydoc.do.txt`.
