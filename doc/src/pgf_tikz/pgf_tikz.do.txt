__Summary.__
Quick demo of how to make figures with TikZ in DocOnce.

======= Ideas =======

"TikZ": "http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~hellmund/LaTeX/pgf-tut.pdf"
is a very strong tool for making figures in LaTeX. DocOnce supports such
figures: if a figure file `myfig` exists in a version `myfig.tikz`,
DocOnce will, in case of `latex` or `pdflatex` output, utilize the
`myfig.tikz` figure directly. The problem is what do to with other
output formats. In HTML formats (`html` and `sphinx`),
one can use a corresponding SVG version of the figure,
and for more primitive formats, one needs a plain PNG
version. DocOnce will automatically create such versions of the figure
and store them along with `myfig.tikz`, as is done when other figure
formats need automatic conversion.

======= A modest beginning =======

FIGURE: [line] This shape is commonly referred to as a *straight line*. label{line}

The most fundamental shape is the line in Figure ref{line}. See the
"source code":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/line.tikz"
for how this TikZ figure is defined in LaTeX as a file `line.tikz`
(and included in DocOnce through `FIGURE: [line] caption`).  Such
lines can be combined to form other shapes, e.g., a "square":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/square.tikz"
as in Figure ref{square}.

FIGURE: [square] This square is formed by four straight lines. label{square}

A "grid":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/grid.tikz"
can also be made from straight lines.

FIGURE: [grid] This is a grid with 5 x 5 cells

A circle, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.
It requires "special code":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/circle.tikz".

FIGURE: [circle] This circle is drawn in blue with a dashed line.

[kgh: filenames identical to words in the texts have been known to cause problems]
[hpl: Not anymore?]

======= More advanced figures =======

FIGURE: [maze] A "maze": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/maze.tikz" can be drawn by combining the elements above.

FIGURE: [graph] TikZ is quite well suited to draw "graphs": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/graph.tikz".


======= Plotting functions =======

TikZ can be used to plot functions. The next figure will be inlined.

FIGURE: [plot1]

See the "source code": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/plot1.tikz" for how you make this figure.

FIGURE: [plot2] The functions can even be labeled!

All details are in the "source code": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/doc/src/pgf_tikz/fig/plot2.tikz".
