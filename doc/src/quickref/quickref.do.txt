_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

__Mission.__ Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of other formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

===== Supported Formats =====

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` or `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * Pandoc-extended or GitHub-flavored Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * Matlab notebook (format `matlabnb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

!bwarning Use a text editor with monospace font!
Some DocOnce constructions are sensitive to whitespace,
so you *must* use a text editor with monospace font.

===== Emacs syntax support =====

The file ".doconce-mode.el":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el"
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Emacs key      | Action                                |
|----l-------------------------l-------------------------|
|  Ctrl+c f      | figure                                |
|  Ctrl+c v      | movie/video                           |
|  Ctrl+c h1     | heading level 1 (section/h1)          |
|  Ctrl+c h2     | heading level 2 (subsection/h2)       |
|  Ctrl+c h3     | heading level 2 (subsection/h3)       |
|  Ctrl+c hp     | heading for paragraph                 |
|  Ctrl+c me     | math environment: `!bt` equation `!et`|
|  Ctrl+c ma     | math environment: `!bt` align `!et`   |
|  Ctrl+c ce     | code environment: `!bc` code `!ec`    |
|  Ctrl+c cf     | code from file: `@@@CODE`             |
|  Ctrl+c table2 | table with 2 columns                  |
|  Ctrl+c table3 | table with 3 columns                  |
|  Ctrl+c table4 | table with 4 columns                  |
|  Ctrl+c exer   | exercise outline                      |
|  Ctrl+c slide  | slide outline                         |
|  Ctrl+c help   | print this table                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|

===== Title, Authors, and Date =====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

!bc do
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
!ec
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
!bc
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
!ec
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Feb 22, 2016`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.

===== Copyright =====

# Recall to ident AUTHOR commands to avoid interpretation

Copyright for selected authors and/or institutions are easy to insert as part
of the `AUTHOR` command. The copyright syntax is

!bc do
{copyright,year1-year2|license}
!ec
and can be placed after the author or after an institution, e.g.,

!bc do
 AUTHOR: name Email: somename@adr.net {copyright,2006-present} at inst1
 AUTHOR: name {copyright} at inst1 {copyright}
!ec
The first line gives `name` a copyright for 2006 up to the present year,
while the second line gives copyright to `name` and the institution `inst1`
for the present year. The license can be any formulation, but there are
some convenient abbreviations for Creative Commons (``public domain'')
licenses: `CC BY` for Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license,
`CC BY-NC` for Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.
For example,

!bc do
 AUTHOR: name1 {copyright|CC BY} at institution1
 AUTHOR: name2 {copyright|CC BY} at institution2
!ec
is a very common copyright for the present year with the Attribution license.
The copyright must be identical for all authors and institutions.


===== Section Types =====
label{quick:sections}

|----------------c---------------------------c---------------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                                |
|----------------l---------------------------l---------------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         |
| abstract                | `__Abstract.__` Running text...              |
| appendix                | `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| appendix                | `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
| exercise                | `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| exercise                | `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

===== Inline Formatting =====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text

!bc
`color{red}{two red words}`
!ec
becomes color{red}{two red words}.
% if FORMAT not in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html"):
(But colors do not work in format ${FORMAT}).
% endif

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

!bc
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
!ec

A forced linebreak is specified by `<linebreak>` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

!bc
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
!ec

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

!bc
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
!ec

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

!bc
---------
!ec

The `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: `---`. Here is an example:

!bc
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
!ec
This text is in the ${FORMAT} rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A & M, is written as a
plain `&` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of `&`, as in `Texas A & M`, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A & M, while words on both sides of `&`, as in `Guns & Roses`,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after `&` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the `html`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex` formats.

Emojis, as defined in URL: "http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com", can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) `:dizzy_face:` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the `pdflatex` and `html` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
`--no_emoji` removes all emojis from the output document.

===== Lists =====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
!bc
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
!ec
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line


!bwarning No indentation - except in lists!
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.
!ewarning


===== Comment lines =====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


===== Inline comments =====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
!bc
[name: running text]
!ec
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, `+` and `-`, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

!bc
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
!ec
which is rendered as

!bquote
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
!equote

The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the `--latex_todonotes`
option to `doconce format`, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
`todonotes` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
!ec
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
!bc sys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

!bc
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
!ec

For example, the text

!bc
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
!ec
can be edited as

!bc
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
!ec
which in the ${FORMAT} output format results in

!bquote
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
!equote

To implement these edits, run

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

===== Verbatim/Computer Code =====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
!bc
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
!ec
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

!bc cod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
!ec

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
!bc
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
!ec
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active for
`latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (`envir=shpro`) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (`shpro`) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to `!bc shcod`, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

The `--code_prefix=text` option adds a path `text` to the filename specified
in the `@@@CODE` command (URLs work). For example

!bc
 @@@CODE src/myfile.py
!ec
and `--code_prefix=http://some.place.net`, the file

!bc
http://some.place.net/src/myfile.py
!ec
will be included. If source files have a header with author, email, etc.,
one can remove this header by the option `'--code_skip_until=# ---`.
The lines up to and including (the first) `# ---` will then be excluded.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
!bc
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
!ec
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
## Note: |bt and |et (and |bc and |ec below) are used to illustrate
## tex and code blocks in inside verbatim blocks and are replaced
## by !bt, !et, !bc, and !ec after all other formatting is finished.

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
Here is a single equation:

!bc
|bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
|et
!ec
which results in

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et


__LaTeX Newcommands.__
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire `newcommand` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

# include with mako must be in this root tree, so we need a link, see make.sh

<%include file="guidelines.do.txt" />

===== Hyperlinks =====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

!bc
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
!ec

===== Figures and Movies =====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
!bc
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

!ec
Note three important syntax details:

  o A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
  o no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,
  o all of the command must appear on a single line,
  o there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

The command-line options `--fig_prefix=...` and `--mov_prefix=...` can
be used to add a path (can be a URL) to all figure and movie files,
respectively.  This is useful when including DocOnce documents in
other DocOnce documents such that the text is compiled in different
directories (with different paths to the figure directory).

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
!bc sys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
!ec
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

!ec
The latter results in

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.


===== Tables =====

The table in Section ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
!bc

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

!ec

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
   One can also use `X` for potentially very wide text that must be
   wrapped and left-adjusted (will only affect `latex` and `pdflatex` where the
   `tabularx` package is then used; `X` means `l` in all other formats).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

A quick way of generating tables is to place all the entries in a file
with comma as separator (a CSV file) and then run the utility
`doconce csv2table` to create a table in the DocOnce format.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
!ec
Now we can do `# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in `mydata_table.do.txt`
into the DocOnce file.

===== Labels and References =====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
!bc
label{name}
!ec
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like `:` or `_` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
!bc
ref{name}
!ec
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


===== Citations and Bibliography =====

Single citations are written as
!bc
cite{name}
!ec
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
!bc
cite{name1,name2,name3}
!ec

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
"Publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

===== Generalized References =====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

!bc do
ref[internal][cite][external]
!ec
with a specific example being

!bc do
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
!ec
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
references with `ref` in the text `internal` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if `cite` is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex`, one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line
`# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal` followed by `cite`,
and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

===== Index of Keywords =====

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
!bc
index{name}
!ec
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

===== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` =====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

@@@CODE doconce_program.sh

===== Exercises =====

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
!bc
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

|bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
|ehint

|bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
|ehint
!ec
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

!bc
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
!ec
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

|bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

|bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
|eans

|bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
|ehint

|bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

|bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
|ehint

|bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
|esol
|esubex

|bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
|eremarks

|bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
|esol

!ec
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


===== Environments =====

DocOnce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `hint`: multiple help items in an exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (sometimes) background color
 * `block`, `box`: simpler boxes (`block` may have title but never any icon)
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

In addition, the user can define new environments `!bc-name` as
explained in the "manual": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html#manual:userdef:envir".

===== Preprocessing =====

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, ``comment out'' a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

!bc do
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
!ec

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "example document": "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).
