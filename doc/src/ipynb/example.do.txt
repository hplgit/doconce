===== Mathematics =====

A differential equation for linear vibrations,

!bt
\[ mu'' + bu' + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V,\]
!et
can be solved numerically by a scheme

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^{n+1} = \left(2mu^n + (\frac{b}{2}\Delta t - m)u^{n-1} +
\Delta t^2(F^n - s(u^n))
\right)(m + \frac{b}{2}\Delta t)^{-1},
label{bumpy:u:scheme:lin}
\end{equation}
!et
for $n=0,1,\ldots$, but with a special formula for $n=0$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t\, V
+ \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}(-bV - s(u^0) + F^0)
\thinspace .
label{bumpy:u:scheme0:lin}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Implementation =====

# Note: Plain Markdown cannot refer to equations with numbers.
# This is a DocOnce extension.

The formulas (ref{bumpy:u:scheme:lin}) and (ref{bumpy:u:scheme0:lin})
can be implemented as follows in a Python function:

# Next code (hidden code):
# Not strictly needed since zeros inside the next function
# is not called before the main program has imported zeros...
# But in general one may need special imports for the next
# code segments to execute properly.

!bc pyhid
from numpy import zeros
!ec

!bc pycod
def solver_linear_damping(I, V, m, b, s, F, t):
    N = t.size - 1              # No of time intervals
    dt = t[1] - t[0]            # Time step
    u = zeros(N+1)              # Result array
    u[0] = I
    u[1] = u[0] + dt*V + dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V - s(u[0]) + F[0])

    for n in range(1,N):
        u[n+1] = 1./(m + b*dt/2)*(2*m*u[n] + \
                 (b*dt/2 - m)*u[n-1] + dt**2*(F[n] - s(u[n])))
    return u
!ec

===== Dissection =====

# Code here is not meant to be executed, just shown for discussion.

The array `t` holds all the time points where we want a solution.
The total number of intervals, $N$, is then computed as

!bc pycod-t
N = t.size - 1   # or len(t) - 1
!ec
Creating an array of length $N+1$ where we can store the solution
is done by

!bc pycod-t
u = zeros(N+1)
!ec
% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
For such a statement to work, we must have done a

!bc pycod
from numpy import zeros
!ec
% endif

For loops over array indices are coded as

!bc pycod-t
for n in range(1, N):
    ...
!ec
which generates a sequence of integers from 1 up to `N`, *but not
including* `N`.

===== Usage =====

The function `solve_linear_damping` resides in a file `solver.py`.

# Need to tell where solver.py is for the notebook to execute properly.
# For this we use a hidden python code (pyhid). It will be hidden
# in all formats, except in the notebook.

!bc pyhid
# The solver module is in src/solver.py; tell Python about that
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
!ec

# For matplotlib we need to insert %matplotlib inline in the notebook.
# (Automatically done by DocOnce.)

!bc pycod
from solver import solver_linear_damping
from numpy import linspace, zeros, pi

def s(u):
    return 2*u

T = 10*pi      # simulate for t in [0,T]
dt = 0.2
N = int(round(T/dt))
t = linspace(0, T, N+1)
F = zeros(t.size)
I = 1; V = 0
m = 2; b = 0.2
u = solver_linear_damping(I, V, m, b, s, F, t)

from matplotlib.pyplot import *
plot(t, u)
show()
!ec

% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':
The result is the figure below.
