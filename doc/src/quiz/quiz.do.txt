TITLE: A Software Tool for Typesetting Quizzes
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today


__Summary.__ This note describes a system for writing quizzes
(multiple-choice questions) in a compact text format with support
for mathematics, computer code, and flexible formatting. The text
format can be automatically translated to HTML and to a Python
data structure. The HTML can be rendered directly in web pages,
and the data structure can (in the future) be fed to online quiz/survey
services a la Kahoot, JotForm, and Google forms.

======= A pure text quiz =======

===== Question and choices =====

Here is a typical quiz with a question and four alternative answers:

!bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?
Cw: Helsinki
Cw: Drammen
Cr: Oslo
Cw: Denmark
!equiz
# #if FORMAT == "html"
Click on the pencil symbol to the left of _Choice_ to see whether the choice is
correct or not.
# #endif

The above quiz can be specified by the compact text

!bc
|bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?
Cw: Helsinki
Cw: Drammen
Cr: Oslo
Cw: Denmark
|equiz
!ec

!bnotice Syntax:

 * The quiz is specified between `!bquiz`
   (``begin quiz'') and `!equiz` (``end quiz'') tags.
 * The question starts right after `Q:` (``question'').
 * Wrong choices are specified with `Cw:`, and right choices with `Cr:`.
 * The instructions `!bquiz`, `!equiz`, `Q:`, `Cw:`, and `Cr:` must appear
   at the beginning of a line.
 * The text of (e.g.) a wrong answer (`Cr:`) lasts up to the next
   instruction (like `Cw:`, `Cr:`, `!equiz`).
 * One can have as many wrong and right
   choices as desired.

!enotice

Multiple correct choices are possible. Here is an example with three
right choices:

!bc
|bquiz
Q: Which of the following cities are capitals?
Cw: Sidney
Cr: Kigali
Cw: Bonn
Cr: Bern
Cr: Ottawa
Cw: New York
|equiz
!ec

!bquiz
Q: Which of the following cities are capitals?
Cw: Sidney
Cr: Kigali
Cw: Bonn
Cr: Bern
Cr: Ottawa
Cw: New York
!equiz


===== Explanations of choices =====

Sometimes it is desireable to give some explanation why certain choices
are wrong (or right).
If you click on the symbols in the quiz below, explanations
will be shown for Choices 1 and 2.

!bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: Helsinki
E: Helsinki is the capital of Finland.

Cw: Drammen
E: Drammen is a small city close to Oslo.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
!equiz
The quiz syntax applies `E: ...` after the choice to
give an explanation of that choice.

!bc
|bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: Helsinki
E: Helsinki is the capital of Finland.

Cw: Drammen
E: Drammen is a small city close to Oslo.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
|equiz
!ec
This time we also added some whitespace for enhanced reading of the text.

===== Typesetting =====

It is easy to use *emphasize font*, _boldface_, color{red}{color},
"hyperlinks": "http://google.com", etc.,
since the text in the specification of questions, choices,
and explanations are rendered according to the
"DocOnce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" markup language.
For simple typesetting (emphasize, boldface, links) DocOnce also
accepts Markdown syntax.
Here is an example:

!bquiz
Q: This is a very famous quote:

!bquote
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*
!equote
This quote is attributed to

Cw: Geroge W. Bush

Cr: Donald Knuth
E: According to "Wikiquote": "http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth",
Donald Knuth wrote this statement in *Structured Programming with
Goto Statements*. Computing Surveys, _6_:4,
pp. 261-301, _1974_.

Cw: Ole-Johan Dahl
E: Ole-Johan Dahl was a famous Norwegian professor of computer
science and together with Kristen Nygaard the inventor of
object-oriented programming, but he is not the man behind this
quote.
!equiz

The corresponding specification reads

!bc

# #ifdef DOCONCE
===== Quiz inside admonitions in DocOnce =====

Question admonitions may well feature quizzes. A plain question
admonition is

!bquestion
What is the capital of Norway?
!equestion
specified by the DocOnce syntax

!bc
|bquestion
What is the capital of Norway?
|equestion
!ec
The quiz version is

!bquestion
!bquiz
Q: [] What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: [Answer:] Stockholm
E: Stockholm is the capital of Sweden, Norway's neighboring country.

Cw: Bergen
E: Some people from Bergen may claim so... It is just the second
largest city in Norway.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
!equiz
!equestion
specified as

!bc
|bquestion
|bquiz
Q: [] What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: [Answer:] Stockholm
E: Stockholm is the capital of Sweden, Norway's neighboring country.

Cw: Bergen
E: Some people from Bergen may claim so... It is just the second
largest city in Norway.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
|equiz
|equestion
!ec

!bnotice Choice and question prefix
In the above example, we demonstrate the possibility to control
the word preceding the question and the choices.
# #if FORMAT in ("html",)
For the current HTML format, questions are by default preceded by
`Question:` and choices by `Choice X:`, where `X` is the
number of the choice.
# #endif
The prefix appears inside square brackets. Empty brackets, as those
in the question, leads to no prefix. The choice `Stockholm` has
a prefix `[Answer:]`, and exactly the text inside the square brackets
precedes the text of this choice in the output.
!enotice

# #endif

======= Typesetting of mathematics and computer code =======

===== Mathematics =====
label{sec:math}

Mathematical typesetting follows a restricted LaTeX syntax. Inline
formulas appear inside dollar signs, while separate equations
appear inside `!bt` (``begin TeX'') and `!et` (``end TeX'') tags.

=== Simple example ===

!bquiz
Q: Compute the result of $a+b$ in the case $a=2$ and $b=2$.

Cw: 5.

E: Good attempt, especially when referring to the following story.

!bquote
An anthropologist was asking a primitive tribesman about arithmetic.
When the anthropologist asked, *What does two and two make?* the
tribesman replied, *Five.* Asked to explain, the tribesman said, *If I
have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two knots, and I
join the ropes together, then I have five knots.*
!equote

Cr: 4.
E: Seems trivial, but once upon a time...

FIGURE: [fig/1p1, width=140 frac=0.2]

Cw: The computation does not make sense when $a$ and $b$ are given without
units.

E: It is indeed possible to add pure numbers without any units.
!equiz

The source code for defining the above quiz reads

!bc
|bquiz
Q: Compute the result of $a+b$ in the case $a=2$ and $b=2$.

Cw: 5.

E: Good attempt, especially when referring to the following story.

|bquote
An anthropologist was asking a primitive tribesman about arithmetic.
When the anthropologist asked, *What does two and two make?* the
tribesman replied, *Five.* Asked to explain, the tribesman said, *If I
have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two knots, and I
join the ropes together, then I have five knots.*
|equote

Cr: 4.
E: Seems trivial, but once upon a time...

FIGURE: [fig/1p1, width=180 frac=0.3]

Cw: The computation does not make sense when $a$ and $b$ are given without
units.

E: It is indeed possible to add pure numbers without any units.
|equiz
!ec

!bwarning Only a subset of LaTeX equation environment is supported!
To make sure blocks with equations come out correctly in different
output formats (LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown), only four types
of standard LaTeX equation environments should be used:

 o Single equation without number: `\[ ... \]` or `equation*` environment
 o Single equation with number: `equation` environment
 o Multiple, aligned equations without numbers: `align*` environment
 o Multiple, aligned equations with numbers: `align` environment

This means that one has to stay away from `eqnarray`, `alignat`,
and other common LaTeX equation environments. However, inside an equation,
standard LaTeX math typesetting works (like `\alpha`, `\mbox{...}`, etc.).
!ewarning

=== A more complicated example ===

!bquiz
Q: The equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0
label{cont:eq}
\end{equation}
!et
is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):

K: gradient; divergence; curl; vector calculus
L: div:assert

Cw: The equation tells that the net outflow of something with
velocity $\bm{u}$ in region is zero.
E: This is right: integrating (ref{cont:eq}) over an arbitrary domain
$\Omega$ and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we get the surface integral

!bt
\[ \int_{\partial\Omega}\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS=0,\]
!et
where $\bm{n}$ is an outward unit normal on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The quantity $\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS$ is the outflow of volume per
time unit if $\bm{u}$ is velocity.

Cw: The equation tells that the vector field $\bm{u}$ is divergence free.
E: Yes, *divergence free* is often used as synonym for *zero divergence*,
and $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}$ is the divergence of a vector field $\bm{u}$.

Cw: The equation implies that there exists a vector potential $\bm{A}$
such that $\bm{u}=\nabla\times\bm{A}$.
E: Yes, this is an important result in vector calculus that is much
used in electromagnetics.

Cr: The equation implies $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.
E: No, only if $\bm{u}=\nabla\phi$, for some scalar potential $\phi$,
we have $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.

Cr: The equation implies that $\bm{u}$ must be a constant vector field.
E: No, it is the *sum* of derivatives of different components of $\bm{u}$
that is zero. Only in one dimension, where $\bm{u}=u_x\bm{i}$
and consequently $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=du/dx$, the vector field must be constant.
!equiz

The corresponding code needed to define this quiz is listed below.
Note two new features:

 * The `K: gradient; divergence; ...`
   construction allows specification of a set of keywords separated
   by semi-colon. The feature is handy when automatically selecting
   quizzes from a large database. There is no output of the keywords
   in typeset quizzes.
 * `L: div:assert` defines a label for the quiz. This can be used
   as a logical name in the same way as labels are used in LaTeX.
   For example, a collection of labels can be specified for selecting
   a collection quizzes. The label is invisible in a typeset quiz.

Keywords and label should appear before or right after the question.

!bc
|bquiz
Q: The equation

|bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0
label{cont:eq}
\end{equation}
|et
is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):

K: gradient; divergence; curl; vector calculus
L: div:assert

Cw: The equation tells that the net outflow of something with
velocity $\bm{u}$ in region is zero.
E: This is right: integrating (ref{cont:eq}) over an arbitrary domain
$\Omega$ and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we get the surface integral

|bt
\[ \int_{\partial\Omega}\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS=0,\]
|et
where $\bm{n}$ is an outward unit normal on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The quantity $\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS$ is the outflow of volume per
time unit if $\bm{u}$ is velocity.

Cw: The equation tells that the vector field $\bm{u}$ is divergence free.
E: Yes, *divergence free* is often used as synonym for *zero divergence*,
and $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}$ is the divergence of a vector field $\bm{u}$.

Cw: The equation implies that there exists a vector potential $\bm{A}$
such that $\bm{u}=\nabla\times\bm{A}$.
E: Yes, this is an important result in vector calculus that is much

we have $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.

Cr: The equation implies that $\bm{u}$ must be a constant vector field.

that is zero. Only in one dimension, where $\bm{u}=u_x\bm{i}$
and consequently $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=du/dx$, the vector field must be constant.

===== Computer code =====

Inline computer code (variables, expressions, statements) are
normally typeset with a monospace font, and this is enabled by
enclosing the code in backticks. Blocks of computer code are typeset
with `!bc` (``begin code'') and `!ec` (``end code'') tags.
One can specify the computer language as part of the `!bc` tag:
`!bc LX`, where `L` is the language (`py` for Python, `m` for Matlab,
`cpp` for C++, for instance) and `X` can be `pro` for a complete
executable program or `cod` for a code snippet (cannot be executed without
additional statements) [^hide-code]. The quizzes below demonstrate the syntax.

[^hide-code]: `X` can also be `hide` for code that is not supposed to be
shown, but possibly required to execute other snippets in an
interactive document (that allows code to be edited and executed
by the reader). This is currently being implemented in DocOnce's
support for Runestone Interactive books (using the Sphinx format).

!bquiz
Q: We want to create a Python list object of length `n` where each
element is `0`. Is the following code then what we need?

!bc pycod
import numpy
mylist = numpy.zeros(n)
!ec

K: list, array

Cw: Yes.

E: Not exactly: `numpy.zeros` creates an array of zeros, not a list.

Cw: Yes, provided we write `np` instead of `numpy`:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
mylist = np.zeros(n)
!ec

E: No, this is fully equivalent to the original code, so `mylist` becomes
an array, not a list.

Cr: No.
E: One would need to do `mylist = [0]*n` or `numpy.zeros(n).tolist()`.

===== Example: Putting it all together =====

!bquiz
Q:

!bc pypro
from math import sin

def D(u, t, dt=1E-5):
    return (u(t + dt) - u(t - dt))/(2*dt)

def u(t):
    "A quadratic function."
    return t^2

print D(u, t=4),
print D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)
!ec
The purpose of this program is to differentiate the two mathematical
functions

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t) &= t^2,\\
f(x) &= 2x.
\end{align*}
!et
Determine which of the following assertions that is _wrong_.

K: Python programming; debugging; lambda functions; finding errors

Cw: In Python, the syntax for $t^2$ is `t**2`, not `t^2`, so the
`u` function contains an error.
E: True. However, `t^2` will work for integer `t` in Python,
but the computation is nonsense in this case since $u(t)$ is
supposed to be $t^2$.

Cw: The string in the `u` function is a valid doc string.
E: Yes, a doc string can be any string after the function heading. It can
have single quotes `'...'`, double quotes `"..."`,
triple single quotes `'''...'''`, or triple double quotes `"""..."""`.
The latter is the most popular for doc strings. Recall that triple quotes
allow the string to span multiple lines.

Cw: The output from the program is on a single line, despite two `print`
statements.
E: Yes, because of the comma after the first `print` statement: it suppresses
the newline character that is normally appended to `print` statements in
Python.

Cr: One cannot use `u` both inside the `D` function and in the
outer calling code (the main program).
E: Yes, you can, because the `u` argument in the `D` function (holding
a function) is a *local* variable inside the `D` function. The `u` in
the calling code is *global* variable, holding a function object.
Inside `D`, `u` refers to the local variable, while in the main
program, `u` refers to the global variable, and the local variable `u`
in `D` no longer exists, because it was deleted when returning from
the function.  Inside `D`, we can actually access the global `u` by
`globals()['u']`, but that almost never comes to use and is also bad
coding.

Cw: The call `D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)` is equivalent to defining

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return 2*x

!ec
and then calling `D(f, 2)`.

E: `f(x)` is defined as a lambda function, which is a short-hand for
defining functions as an expression, in a function call as here, or
in the right-hand side of an assignment, e.g.,

!bc pycod
f = lambda x: return 2*x
!ec

Cw: There is danger of integer division in the `D` function.

E: True, here is an example: `D(lambda t: t, dt=1)`. We get
`(t+1 - t-1)/(2*1)`, which for any integer `t` gives `int/int`
and hence integer division.

Cw: The `D` function computes an approximate derivative of the
function `u(t)`.

E: Yes, `D` applies a widely used finite difference approximation
formula to the derivative.

Cw: Both calls to `D` results in the exact derivative, provided we
replace `t^2` by `t**2`.

E: Yes, the finite difference approximation used in `D` is exact
for quadratic polynomials!

===== Specification in HTML =====

Instead of using the compact text specification with DocOnce
formatting, one can use a more verbose syntax and specify everything
in HTML. The second example in Section ref{sec:math} then reads

## Note that the HTML text is indented such that it is not interpreted
## as a quiz by DocOnce.

 The equation

 is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):
 <!-- --- end quiz question --- -->
 <!-- --- keywords:['gradient', 'divergence', 'curl', 'vector calculus'] -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->
 The equation tells that the net outflow of something with

 <!-- --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin explanation of choice 1 --- -->
 This is right: integrating \eqref{cont:eq} over an arbitrary
 domain \( \Omega \) and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we
 get the surface integral

 $$ \int_{\partial\Omega}\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}dS=0,$$

 where \( \boldsymbol{n} \) is an outward unit normal on the
 boundary \( \partial\Omega \).
 The quantity \( \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}dS \) is the
 outflow of volume per time unit if \( \boldsymbol{u} \) is
 velocity.
 <!-- --- end explanation of choice 1 --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->
 The equation tells that the vector field \( \boldsymbol{u} \)
 is divergence free.
 <!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
 Yes, <em>divergence free</em> is often used as synonym for
 <em>zero divergence</em>, and \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} \)
 is the divergence of a vector field \( \boldsymbol{u} \).
 <!-- --- end explanation of choice 2 --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->
 The equation implies \( \nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}=0 \).
 <!-- --- end quiz choice 4 (right) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin explanation of choice 4 --- -->
 No, only if \( \boldsymbol{u}=\nabla\phi \), for some scalar
 potential \( \phi \), we have \( \nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}=0 \).
 <!-- --- end explanation of choice 4 --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 5 (right) --- -->
 The equation implies that \( \boldsymbol{u} \)

 No, it is the <em>sum</em> of derivatives of different components
 of \( \boldsymbol{u} \) that is zero. Only in one dimension,
 where \( \boldsymbol{u}=u_x\boldsymbol{i} \) and consequently
 \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=du/dx \), the vector field must be
 constant.

======= The Python data structure for quizzes =======

When a DocOnce file `mydoc.do.txt` containing quizzes (and other types
of text, like this document) is translated to some format by the
`doconce format` command, a Python list of all the quizzes is created
and written to `.mydoc.quiz`. Each list element represents one quiz as
a dictionary. The list corresponding to the quizzes in the current
document starts with

!bc pycod
[{'choices': [[u'wrong', u'Helsinki'],
              [u'wrong', u'Drammen'],
              [u'right', u'Oslo'],
              [u'wrong', u'Denmark']],
  'no': 1,
  'question': u'What is the capital of Norway?'},
!ec

A more complicated quiz with specification of prefix for the question and
one choice (see example above in the question admonition) has explanations
in the list for each choice, as well as two more
keys (`choice prefix` and `question prefix`):

!bc pycod
 {'choice prefix': [u'Answer:', None, None, None],
  'choices': [
    [u'wrong',
     u'Stockholm',
     u"Stockholm is the capital of Sweden, Norway's neighboring country."],
    [u'wrong',
     u'Bergen',
     u'Some people from Bergen may claim so... It is just the second\nlargest city in Norway.'],
    [u'right', u'Oslo'],
    [u'wrong', u'Denmark']],
  'no': 5,
  'question': u'What is the capital of Norway?',
  'question prefix': u''},
!ec

The text in the Python list-dictionary data structure is ready-made for
being displayed in HTML. Here is an example involving mathematics
(MathJax syntax):

!bc pycod
 {'choices': [
   [u'wrong',
    u'5.',

man said, <em>If I\n    have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two kn

  'no': 6,
  'question': u'Compute the result of \\( a+b \\) in the case \\( a=2 \\) and \\( b=2 \\).'},
!ec

Computer code gets typeset by nice colors by default (using the Pygments
package):

!bc pycod
{'choices':
   [[u'wrong',
     u'Yes.',
     u'Not exactly: <code>numpy.zeros</code> creates an array of zeros

# this document has !bquiz outside quiz environments (the method to
# extract the previous section header does not work in that case.)

The keys in the dictionaries in this data structure are

 * `question`: the text of the question. This key is always present.
 * `no`: the number of the quiz (starts at 1). This key is always present.
 * `keywords`: an optional list of keywords for the quiz.
 * `label`: an optional logical name for this quiz.
 * `choices`: list of all the choices as 2- or 3-lists. First element
   is `right` or `wrong`, second is the text of the choice, the optional
   third element is the explanation (if it was specified). This key
   is always present.
 * `choice prefix`: optional list of the prefix specified for each choice.
   `None` implies the default prefix (depends on the format,
   see the documentation
   of the `--quiz_choice_prefix=` option by typing `doconce format --help`).
   This key is absent if there are no specifications of such a prefix.
 * `question prefix`: The optional prefix specified for the question,
   if different from the default value `Question:`.
 * `new page`: Optional headline for a new page of quizzes. Also
   indicates that a new page is to be made.

======= Interpreting the quiz format =======

The program `doconce` must be run to interpret the quiz format, translate
it to LaTeX, HTML, or other formats, and produce the Python representation
of the collection of quizzes in a document. Let the name of the
document with quiz specifications and optional text be `myquiz.do.txt`.
Documents to play around with are "`pure_quiz.do.txt`": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/tree/master/doc/src/quiz/pure_quiz.do.txt" or
"the present document": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/tree/master/doc/src/quiz/quiz.do.txt".

===== HTML =====

=== Plain HTML ===

A simple HTML rendering of quizzes is done by

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html myquiz
!ec
The result `myquiz.html` can be loaded into a browser.

=== Bootstrap HTML ===

A more sophisticated rendering is offered if a Bootstrap HTML style
is adopted,

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html myquiz --html_style=bootstrap
!ec
Other variations of this class of styles are `bootswatch`, and
`bootswatch_X`, where `X` is the name of a Bootswatch style, e.g.,
`journal`.

The Bootstrap-based styles have a striking red color for inline computer
code, which can be avoided by giving the option `html_code_style=inherit`.
See the documentation of "DocOnce and Bootstrap": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/bootstrap/index.html" for details and examples.

By default, there is a horizontal rule enclosing each quiz in the HTML format.
This can be turned off by the option `--quiz_horizontal_rule=off`.

=== Multiple page HTML document ===

By inserting `!split` before headings in a DocOnce document, one can run

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce split_html myquiz.html
!ec
to create a multi-page document with navigation arrows. Bootstrap styles
will also have a *Contents* pull-down menu to the right in the top bar.
Without the `split_html` command (and `!split` instructions in the document),
all the text will be in one HTML page.

=== Setting the question and choice prefix ===

The prefix before a question is `Question:` and before a choice is `Choice X`,
where `X` is a number. To set a different prefix, see the
`--quiz_question_prefix` and `--quiz_choice_prefix` commands
when running `doconce format --help`.

===== LaTeX =====

The standard command to produce a LaTeX document is

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex myquiz \
          --without_answers --without_solutions
!ec
If desired, the correct answer to each quiz can be included by omitting
`--without_answers`. Omitting `--without_solutions` will print
the right answers and the available explanations below the quiz.

The next steps are

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex myquiz envir=minted
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape myquiz
!ec
to produce a PDF `myquiz.pdf`. The `doconce ptex2tex` step enables a lot
of different typesetting of blocks of computer code.
Here, we use the `minted` style, which applies the Pygments package.
The default (no `envir` specification) is a plain LaTeX verbatim environment.
Even more possibilities for typesetting computer code exist if
one runs the `ptex2tex` program (and not `doconce ptex2tex`).
