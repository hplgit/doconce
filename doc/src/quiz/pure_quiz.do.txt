# Quiz 6

!bquiz
Q: Compute the result of $a+b$ in the case $a=2$ and $b=2$.

Cw: 5.

E: Good attempt, especially when referring to the following story.

!bquote
An anthropologist was asking a primitive tribesman about arithmetic.
When the anthropologist asked, *What does two and two make?* the
tribesman replied, *Five.* Asked to explain, the tribesman said, *If I
have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two knots, and I
join the ropes together, then I have five knots.*
!equote

Cr: 4.
E: Seems trivial, but once upon a time...

FIGURE: [fig/1p1, width=140 frac=0.2]

Cw: The computation does not make sense when $a$ and $b$ are given without
units.

E: It is indeed possible to add pure numbers without any units.

# Quiz 7

!bquiz
Q: The equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0
label{cont:eq}
\end{equation}
!et
is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):

K: gradient; divergence; curl; vector calculus

Cw: The equation tells that the net outflow of something with
velocity $\bm{u}$ in region is zero.
E: This is right: integrating (ref{cont:eq}) over an arbitrary domain
$\Omega$ and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we get the surface integral

!bt
\[ \int_{\partial\Omega}\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS=0,\]
!et
where $\bm{n}$ is an outward unit normal on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The quantity $\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS$ is the outflow of volume per
time unit if $\bm{u}$ is velocity.

Cw: The equation tells that the vector field $\bm{u}$ is divergence free.
E: Yes, *divergence free* is often used as synonym for *zero divergence*,
and $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}$ is the divergence of a vector field $\bm{u}$.

Cw: The equation implies that there exists a vector potential $\bm{A}$
such that $\bm{u}=\nabla\times\bm{A}$.
E: Yes, this is an important result in vector calculus that is much
used in electromagnetics.

Cr: The equation implies $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.
E: No, only if $\bm{u}=\nabla\phi$, for some scalar potential $\phi$,
we have $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.

Cr: The equation implies that $\bm{u}$ must be a constant vector field.
E: No, it is the *sum* of derivatives of different components of $\bm{u}$
that is zero. Only in one dimension, where $\bm{u}=u_x\bm{i}$
and consequently $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=du/dx$, the vector field must be constant.

# Quiz 8

!bquiz
Q: We want to create a Python list object of length `n` where each
element is `0`. Is the following code then what we need?

!bc pycod
import numpy
mylist = numpy.zeros(n)
!ec

Cw: Yes.

E: Not exactly: `numpy.zeros` creates an array of zeros, not a list.

Cw: Yes, provided we write `np` instead of `numpy`:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
mylist = np.zeros(n)
!ec

E: No, this is fully equivalent to the original code, so `mylist` becomes
an array, not a list.

Cr: No.
E: One would need to do `mylist = [0]*n` or `numpy.zeros(n).tolist()`.

# Quiz 9

!bquiz
Q:

!bc pypro
from math import sin

def D(u, t, dt=1E-5):
    return (u(t + dt) - u(t - dt))/(2*dt)

def u(t):
    "A quadratic function."
    return t^2

print D(u, t=4),
print D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)
!ec
The purpose of this program is to differentiate the two mathematical
functions

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t) &= t^2,\\
f(x) &= 2x.
\end{align*}
!et
Determine which of the following assertions that is _wrong_.

Cw: In Python, the syntax for $t^2$ is `t**2`, not `t^2`, so the
`u` function contains an error.
E: True. However, `t^2` will work for integer `t` in Python, but the computation is nonsense in this case since $u(t)$ is supposed to be $t^2$.

Cw: The string in the `u` function is a valid doc string.
E: Yes, a doc string can be any string after the function heading. It can
have single quotes `'...'`, double quotes `"..."`,
triple single quotes `'''...'''`, or triple double quotes `"""..."""`.
The latter is the most popular for doc strings. Recall that triple quotes
allow the string to span multiple lines.

Cw: The output from the program is on a single line, despite two `print`
statements.
E: Yes, because of the comma after the first `print` statement: it suppresses
the newline character that is normally appended to `print` statements in
Python.

Cr: One cannot use `u` both inside the `D` function and in the
outer calling code (the main program).
E: Yes, you can, because the `u` argument in the `D` function
(holding a function)
is a *local* variable inside the `D` function. The `u` in the calling
code is *global* variable, holding a function object.
Inside `D`, `u` refers to the
local variable, while in the main program, `u` refers to the
global variable, and the local variable `u` in `D` no longer exists, because
it was deleted when returning from the function.
Inside `D`, we can actually access the global `u` by `globals()['u']`,
but that almost never comes to use and is also bad coding.

Cw: The call `D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)` is equivalent to defining

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return 2*x

!ec
and then calling `D(f, 2)`.

E: `f(x)` is defined as a lambda function, which is a short-hand for
defining functions as an expression, in a function call as here, or
in the right-hand side of an assignment, e.g.,

!bc pycod
f = lambda x: return 2*x
!ec

Cw: There is danger of integer division in the `D` function.

E: True, here is an example: `D(lambda t: t, dt=1)`. We get
`(t+1 - t-1)/(2*1)`, which for any integer `t` gives `int/int`
and hence integer division.

Cw: The `D` function computes an approximate derivative of the
function `u(t)`.

E: Yes, `D` applies a widely used finite difference approximation
formula to the derivative.

Cw: Both calls to `D` results in the exact derivative, provided we
replace `t^2` by `t**2`.

E: Yes, the finite difference approximation used in `D` is exact
for quadratic polynomials!
