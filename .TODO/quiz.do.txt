TITLE: Ideas for automatically generating surveys and quizzes
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen
DATE: today

__Summary.__
We want to create (large amounts of)
online surveys and quizzes, primarily for use
in regular university teaching and various tutorials and short courses.
Our scientific topic is the blend of physics, mathematics, and programming so
most questions will involve
*mathematics that must be typeset with LaTeX*, and
*computer code that must be shown in monospace font with
all spaces preserved, but preferably prettified with colored
syntax highlighting*.

In addition, we will frequently need images, videos, and some control
of basic HTML formatting (emphasize, tables, etc.). How can we
do this effectively and without being tied forever to a particular
web service?

!bquestion Idea
There are numerous web services with support for surveys and quizzes.
Most of these demand the questions to be typed in interactively.
We foresee to build a database of a huge number of questions that can
be combined, merged, split, and manipulated in various ways as
courses and topics evolve dynamically with time. Therefore, *we need
to automate the construction of surveys and quizzes in a program*.
Only web services that has an API or file format for creating questions are of
interest.

===== More specific problem statement =====

Given data for surveys and quizzes, available in some format,
typically as text in files (which can be loaded into a Python data structure),
how can we turn that information into live surveys and quizzes in
online forms at Google, SurveyGizmo, ClassMarker, Kahoot, JotForm, etc.?
Specifically, our text has

 * mathematics in LaTeX
   * inlined in text
   * equations in blocks
 * computer code
   * inlined in text
   * blocks with computer code (nicely typeset with HTML)
 * simple formatting (emphasize, boldface)
 * images
 * videos
 * tables

HTML and MathJax are sufficient technologies for doing everything we want.
If MathJax cannot be supported by a service, the next best solution is to
automatically generate LaTeX mathematics through a service like
URL: "http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?". Though possible, this
is something we want to avoid.


===== Project status =====

Hans Petter Langtangen has looked at various sites, communicated
with some of the site developers regarding APIs and HTML/MathJax,
and summarized his impressions so far.

===== Preliminary ranking of sites =====

Only two seems to be of relevance for math and code:

 o JotForm
 o Kahoot

We also have a home-made pure HTML solution that easily can
do what we want, but at with any feedback to a database
and hence recording of the students' scores.

These sites are fine for pure text questions:

 o ClassMarker
 o SurveyGizmo
 o Google forms


===== Google forms =====

Google Apps Script is Google's variant of JavaScript and it allows
Google forms to be created by a program. Suppose the data for surveys
and quizzes are available as Python objects. A Python function could
then dump the relevant JavaScript code, and this code can then
manually or automatically be uploaded to a Google form.

 * "Example on generating a form in JavaScript": "https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/"
 * "Video instruction on generating forms from programs": "https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/327782631"
 * "Create a self-grading quiz": "http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/google-in-the-enterprise/use-google-forms-to-create-a-self-grading-quiz/"
 * "Cool example": "https://sites.google.com/site/mrswilsonstechclasses/technology-class-homework"
 * Apps Scripts tutorials: "example 1": "https://sites.google.com/site/appsscripttutorial/miscellaneous/creating-form-elements-dynamically-using-google-apps-script-gas", "example 2": "https://sites.google.com/site/appsscripttutorial/case-studies/case-study-2", "example 3": "https://sites.google.com/site/appsscripttutorial/user-interface/check-box"
 * "Video on getting mathematics into Google forms": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-kpc8zS-Do" (`urllib.quote` can quote URL calls with arguments, also see URL: "'http://latex.codecogs.com/" for turning LaTeX math into PNG images)
 * "Math in Google forms": "http://news.dessci.com/2013/06/for-quick-math-assessments-use-mathtype-with-google-forms.html" (seems to be an interactive tool...?)

!bwarning
Googling seems to indicate that there is no support for MathJax
in Google forms, which means that mathematics must be turned into
images. This requires inline formulas and equations to be separate
objects in the data structure that holds the survey/quiz.

There is a "technical explanation": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mathjax-users/atsUdCzTB-0" for the above conclusion.

===== SurveyGizmo =====

 * One can upload surveys in the form of "pure text or HTML to SurveyGizmo": "http://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-software-features/import-surveys-from-word/". If this supports MathJax and nicely typeset code is an open question. See also "import from Word": "http://surveygizmo.helpgizmo.com/help/article/link/import-from-word".
 * SurveyGizmo also offers "scripting":
   "http://surveygizmoscript.helpgizmo.com/help" and a "REST API":
   "http://apisurveygizmo.helpgizmo.com/help". However, generating surveys
   via manual import of a text file seems much easier.
 * Math in SurveyGizmo is limited to using
   "MathType":
   "http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/works_with.asp#!target=surveygizmo" interactively on Windows...maybe it can be automated?
 * SurveyGizmo is used for "quizzes in teaching": "http://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-blog/customer-innovations-educators-use-online-surveys-for-student-tests-and-quizzes/".

===== JotForm =====

 * Easy "communication via Dropbox": "http://www.jotform.com/dropbox/".
 * Has an  "API": "http://api.jotform.com/docs/".
 * Can "ask questions": "http://api.jotform.com/docs#contact" to the developers.
 * Has a "Python API": "https://github.com/jotform/jotform-api-python" too.
 * JotForm now has a MathJax widget, see the Widget section
   in their form builder.
 * There are a lot of widgets to get sound, radio, youtube, whatever
   into the Jot forms.


===== Kahoot =====

 * Killer feature: This service can embed the quizzes in a gaming environment.
 * Simple and attractive design.
 * Does not support any HTML or MathJax at all, just plain text.
 * Undocumented API, but we can get help to use it.
 * We have contact with the developers regarding

===== ClassMarker =====

 * "ClassMarker": "http://www.classmarker.com" is aimed student tests and exams.
 * Questions can be "imported from file": "http://www.classmarker.com/online-testing/manual/#importquestions". See also "these FAQ instructions": "http://www.classmarker.com/online-testing/faq/?query=multiplechoice#results".
   The import file can use "BBCode": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/.TODO/BBCode4ClassMarker_import.png" to format the plain text. Indentation of the text in the import file will be preserved so Python code can be shown, but *without monospace font*.
 * Classmarker has an "API": "http://www.classmarker.com/online-testing/api/developers/". Communication reaveals that *ClassMarker allows you to import questions at present, but you cannot use our API to remotely add questions.* They also said, *We do not at present all external css formatting sorry. This is something we will be looking at in the future, but I cannot give you an idea on when this may be at this stage sorry.* The API seems to be for analyzing results.
 * There is a "manual": "http://www.classmarker.com/online-testing/manual/".
 * No support for MathJax.
 * No support for HTML of security reasons.

This seems to be a good site for tests without code and math.


===== WordPress Quiz Master Next =====

URL: "http://wordpress.org/plugins/quiz-master-next/"
Might be able to "import quizzes": "http://wordpress.org/support/topic/importfunction". WordPress has some limited LaTeX support.

===== Wufoo =====

Lots of "features": "http://www.wufoo.com/features/", including a
"REST API": "http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/Wufoo-REST-API-V3" and a "Python API": "https://github.com/wufoo/pyfoo".
Here is an example "using Python to create forms and integrate them on a web site": "https://www.wufoo.com/2011/11/14/create-and-grade-quizzes-with-a-little-wufoo-python-and-django/".

!bwarning
The first impression is that questions must be defined interactively.

===== Testmoz =====

 * Testmoz has the possibility to have arbitrary HTML code in questions,
   but not in answers, see the "FAQ": "https://testmoz.com/#faqs".
 * Very simple, but no API. Does not work with MathJax.
 * Conclusion after testing : No option.

===== FluidSurvey =====

They registered my requests, but didn't come back.

===== Zoho Survey =====

This service has confirmed that questions can only be defined interactively
and there is no MathJax support.

===== Evalandgo Survey =====

This service has confirmed that questions can only be defined interactively
and there is no MathJax support.

===== SurveyMonkey =====

This tool "cannot be automated": "http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Can-I-upload-a-survey-created-in-another-file-or-import-responses". Does not seem to be candidate.

===== Home-made solution with JavaScript =====

We have a quiz generator (for programming questions in INF1100) in
plain JavaScript that is a starting point. No database for recording
results, just feedback to the student.

Some useful links for further development:

 * "Basic example with jQuery": "http://www.hungrypiranha.org/make-a-website/html-quiz" (seems to be a way to go)
 * "jQuery.Survey": "http://flesler.webs.com/jQuery.Survey/", see
   "GitHub repo": "https://github.com/jdarling/jQuery.Survey" for use.
   Seems as a small project.
 * "More info on JavaScript for surveys": "http://www.jensbits.com/2010/01/29/pop-up-survey-with-jquery-ui-dialog/"
 * "Another JavaScript quiz example": "https://www.inkling.com/read/javascript-jquery-david-sawyer-mcfarland-2nd/chapter-3/tutorial-a-simple-quiz"

Can relatively easily combine these JavaScript solutions with a database
in Django or Flask. Not exactly sure how this is done without user
login and in a common database...

===== Suggested Python data structure =====

A survey or quiz can be a list of questions. Each question is a
Python `OrderedDict` (dictionary where the keys have a specific ordering).
Typical keys are

 * `title`: question title
 * `text`: running text in HTML (typically expressing the question)
 * `choices`: (choice 1, choice 2, choice 3, ...)
 * `explanations`: (expl 1, expl 2, expl 3, ...) - comments or explanations for why each choice in `choices` is right or wrong
 * `correct`: index/indices in `choices` corresponding to correct answer(s)
 * `input-text`: a free text area with the answer (alternative to `choices`)
 * `input-interpreter`: Python function that can read `input-text` and return
   `True` or `False` if the answer is correct or wrong (will typically
   use some regular expressions to analyze the text)

Headings (pure string) can be inserted in the Python list to
indicate sections of questions, typically corresponding to pages with
a heading in the web form.

Depending on what `text` can contain in the form, it might be necessary to
distinguish between pure text and other elements that require special
typesetting:

 * `video`: (URL of a video, caption, width, height)
 * `image`: (URL of an image, caption, width, height)
 * `equation`: LaTeX
 * `inline-math`: LaTeX
 * `code`: code block
 * `inline-code`: text
 * `points`: no of points for this question

Ideally, all this would just be HTML.
