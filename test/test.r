__Abstract.__
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

# Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
# is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

======= Section 1 =======
label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2
  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
    o first item
    o second item,
      continuing on a new line

!bquote
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.
!equote

Here is a reference to Equation (ref{my:eq1}).
# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html")
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.
# #endif

!split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

===== Subsection 1 =====

More text, with a reference back to Section ref{sec1} and further
to Section ref{subsubsec:ex}. idx{`somefunc` function}

# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f fromto: subroutine@
and then just the subroutine,
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f from-to:a comment@^C\s+END1
and finally the complete file:
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f

Testing other code environments. First Python:
!bc
|bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
|ec
!ec
which gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec

# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html", "latex", "pdflatex")
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:
# #else
Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.
# #endif

!bc pyoptpro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
!ec

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:
# #else
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).
# #endif

!bc pyscpro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
!ec

## Should also test that one can read .pyopt and .pysc programs

Then Cython:
!bc cycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
!ec

# This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
!bc cpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
!ec
# The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

!bc
|bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
|ec
!ec
which then is typeset as

!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec

HTML:

!bc htmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
!ec

System call:
!bc sys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
!ec

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some color{red}{red} color and an attempt to write color{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.} Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


===== Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies =====
label{subsec:ex}
idx{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200] Visualization of flow by streamtubes. label{fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200]

idx{movies}

=== Test of movies ===

Movie ref{mov:tsunami} shows a tsunami.

MOVIE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg, width=700 height=400] Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) label{mov:tsunami}.

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

MOVIE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg, width=700 height=400]

# Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption

   MOVIE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png, width=700 height=400] Movie
based on collection of frames
(here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).
label{mymov}

# Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the
# embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo.

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Computational fluid dynamics movie.


# Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

 FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=500] A long
caption spanning
several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`
as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. label{myfig}

# Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

# Test URL as figure name

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

# Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs
# #if FORMAT == "mwiki"
FIGURE: [testfigs/df_plot.png, width=800] This is a wikimedia figure file.

# Non-uploaded file with no caption
FIGURE: [testfigs/df2s8765s_plot.png, width=200, frac=0.4]
# #endif

# Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

===== The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?) =====
label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
!bc
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
!ec

__More on $\theta$.__ Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}
!et

Or with align with label and numbers:

!bt
\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
!et

% if FORMAT == "sphinx":
Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.
% endif
% if FORMAT == "mwiki":
The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.
% endif

===== Custom Environments =====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.


===== Tables =====
label{subsec:table}

idx{test index with `verbatim text` which is possible}
idx{test `two` (separate) `verbatim expressions` which is also possible}
idx{index with!subindex}

# index with comma could fool sphinx
idx{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in LaTeX, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
label{mytab}
}
% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\end{table}
% endif

The Doconce source code reads
!bc ccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

|-------------------------------|
|$i$ | $h_i$|$\bar T_i$ | `L_i` |
|-l-----r---------r---------r---|
|0   |0     |288        |-0.0065|
|1   |11,000|216        |0.0	|
|2   |20,000|216        |0.001	|
|3   |32,000|228        |0.0028	|
|4   |47,000|270        |0.0	|
|5   |51,000|270        |-0.0028|
|6   |71,000|214        |`NaN`	|
|-------------------------------|

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right after verbatim word (with no space):

|-----------------------------------------|
| exact | `v_1`   | $a_i$ + `v_2`|`verb_3_`|
|---r--------r---------r-----------r------|
|9      | 9.62    | 5.57      |  8.98     |
|-20    | -23.39  | -7.65     | -19.93    |
|10     | 17.74   | -4.50     |  9.96     |
|0      | -9.19   | 4.13      | -0.26     |
|-----------------------------------------|


===== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` =====

__Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.__ Here is
some text.

===== Bibliography test =====

Here is an example: cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work cite{Langtangen_1988d} and cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book cite{Langtangen:91} and the
cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.


===== Example: Examples can be typeset as exercises =====
label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


!bsubex
State some problem.

!bsol
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
State some other problem.

!bhint
A hint can be given.
!ehint

!bhint
Maybe even another hint?
!ehint

!bsol
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.
!esol
!esubex


===== URLs =====
label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl", or
the entire URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".  Here is a
plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt", or
URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link with
newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or "hpl" :
"http://folk.uio.no/hpl". Also `file:///` works: "link to a
file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or just a "mail link": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or a raw URL: "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
"Newton-Cotes":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" formulas
and a "good book":
"http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1". Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas"
and URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
"`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py".

# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
# format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

# Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
# if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
"google": "http://google.com", "google": "http://google.com", and
"google": "http://google.com", which should result in exactly three
footnotes.


% if FORMAT == "latex":

===== Test of Some LaTeX Fixes =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen,
or maybe also prof. Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch. ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App. ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no. $i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.
% endif

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
!et


% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', 'html', 'pandoc'):
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
!bt
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
Testing split:
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to the last equation by (ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
!bt
\begin{gather}
a = b \\
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
!et

Testing alignat:
!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 label{eq1a} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
!et
Let us refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (ref{eq1a})-(ref{eq2a}), and to (ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
% endif

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem ref{demo:ex:1} and Project ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects ref{proj:circle1} and ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise ref{exer:some:formula}.

======= Exercises =======

===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1}
files = flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py
keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

# Torture tests
file=myfile_should_be_a_part_of_the_text
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint

# Test syntax error

  !bhint
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.
  !ehint

!bans
If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
!eans

!bsol
!bc pycod
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
!ec
!esol

=== Remarks ===

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

 o Mark 1.
 o Mark 2.

===== Not an exercise =====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

===== Project: Compute a Probability =====

# Minimalistic exercise

label{demo:ex:2}

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

!bhint
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
!ehint

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

 o item1
 o item2

===== Project: Explore Distributions of Random Circles =====

label{proj:circle1}
file=circles.pdf

The formula for a circle is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
!et
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
!ec

# Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
# which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

!bsubex
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

!bans
Here goes the short answer to part a).
!eans

!bsol
Here goes a full solution to part a).
!esol

!bhint
Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.
!ehint

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "Script for Introduction to Version Control":
"http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

!esummary

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "Dropbox":
"http://dropbox.com" and "Google Drive": "http://drive.google.com".
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


===== Appendix: Testing inline comments =====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl:
not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to URL:"http://dropbox.com" and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

\section{Section 1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.

Here is a reference to Equation (\ref{my:eq1}).

% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\subsection{Subsection 1}

More text, with a reference back to Section~\ref{sec1} and further
to Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex}. \index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file:
\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

System call:
\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

It is time to test \code{verbatim inline font} especially with \code{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \code{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \code{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \code{!bc} and \code{!ec} as well as \code{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like \code{\begin}, \code{\begin{enumerate}},
\code{\end{this}\end{that}}, and \code{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.} Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \code{.tex} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\bccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{L\_i} } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\
5          & 51,000     & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6          & 71,000     & 214        & \code{NaN} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \code{|-} because of a negative number,
and \code{|} right after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{v\_1} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \code{v\_2} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{verb\_3\_} } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\
-20                & -23.39             & -7.65              & -19.93             \\
10                 & 17.74              & -4.50              & 9.96               \\
0                  & -9.19              & 4.13               & -0.26              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \code{file:///} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \code{latex} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \code{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \code{_static*} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\code{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \code{CG-2}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project 3: Compute a Probability}
\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in {\LaTeX}
in previous Doconce versions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
% --- begin hint in exercise ---

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \code{random} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \code{n} points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \code{circle} function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly

% sphinx code--blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}
\noindent

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{minted}
\noindent

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{minted}
\noindent


Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}
\noindent

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
\noindent
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

It is time to test {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!verbatim inline font!} especially with {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!a newline inside the text!} and an exclamation mark at the end: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!BEGIN!}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!Verb!} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!!bc!} and {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!!ec!} as well as {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!!bsummary!}.
Also test backslashes and braces like {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!\begin!}, {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!\begin{enumerate}!},
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!}, and {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!{something \inside braces}!} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.} Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!.tex!} by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |

  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!L\_i!} } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\

\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!|-!} because of a negative number,
and {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!|!} right after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!v\_1!} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!v\_2!} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!verb\_3\_!} } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\

0                  & -9.19              & 4.13               & -0.26              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!file:///!} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!latex!} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!--device=paper!} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay\_mod.py}}}.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!_static*!} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!--device=paper!} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!CG-2!}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project 3: Compute a Probability}
\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in {\LaTeX}
in previous Doconce versions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
% --- begin hint in exercise ---

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!random!} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

\subsection*{Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!n!} points on a circle:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{minted}
\noindent

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\Verb!circle!} function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\protect\Verb!verbatim inline!} }

ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{python:nt}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{python:nt}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{python:nt}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()

Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which then is typeset as

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \Verb!Verb! typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \Verb~!bc~ and \Verb~!ec~ as well as \Verb~!bsummary~.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}! in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.} Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png}}
  \caption{

%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


\begin{center}  % inline figure

\end{center}


\index{movies}

\paragraph{Test of movies.}
Movie~\ref{mov:tsunami} shows a tsunami.


\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

\includemedia[

\end{center}
\caption{Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) \label{mov:tsunami}.}

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

 (Movie \Verb!../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg!: play \href{{wavepacket.html}}{\nolinkurl{wavepacket.html}\footnote{\texttt{wavepacket.html}}})
\includemedia[

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{Verbatim}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\
5          & 51,000     & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6          & 71,000     & 214        & \Verb!NaN! \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \Verb!|-! because of a negative number,
and \Verb!|! right after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!v\_1! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \Verb!v\_2! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!verb\_3\_! } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\
-20                & -23.39             & -7.65              & -19.93             \\
10                 & 17.74              & -4.50              & 9.96               \\
0                  & -9.19              & 4.13               & -0.26              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay\_mod.py}}}.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project 3: Compute a Probability}
\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in {\LaTeX}
in previous Doconce versions:

\begin{enumerate}

\noindent
% --- begin hint in exercise ---

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \Verb!random! module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\begin{python:nt}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{python:nt}

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function
above.

\clearpage

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. \longinlinecomment{mp 2}{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} and watch the video. It explains
how files, like \Verb!myfile.py!, perhaps containing much math, like

More text, with a reference back to the section `Section 1`_ and further
to the section `URLs`_. 
.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console


Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies
----------------------------------------

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure `fig:impact`_ in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of flow by streamtubes*  (fig:impact)


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png

Test of movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Movie `mov:tsunami`_ shows a tsunami.

        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) .</em></p>



Test empty caption (for inline movie):

        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em></em></p>



.. Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption


.. raw:: html
        
        <p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
        <em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).</em></p>



.. Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the

.. embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo.


.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.</em>
        



.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>
        




.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure `myfig`_ with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 500

   *A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$*  (myfig)


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


.. Test URL as figure name



.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)
----------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on \theta.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have `Problem 2: Flip a Coin`_ and `Project 3: Compute a Probability`_,
as well as `Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles`_ and `Project 9: References in a headings do not work well in rst`_, and in
between there we have `Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems`_.

.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _demo:ex:1:

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------
.. keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation


.. Torture tests


Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


.. Test syntax error





Remarks  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Use ``r = random.random()`` and define head as ``r <= 0.5``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---


.. --- begin answer of exercise ---
**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---
**Solution.**
Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

.. _demo:ex:2:

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- end exercise ---




.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

A Document for Testing Doconce
==============================

:Date: Jan 32, 2100

.. !split





The format of this document is
sphinx

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. is mutually exclusive in LaTeX


.. _sec1:


Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line



..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.



Here is a reference to Equation :eq:`my:eq1`.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

.. !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment


Subsection 1
------------

More text, with a reference back to the section :ref:`sec1` and further
to the section :ref:`subsubsec:ex`. 
.. index:: somefunc function


.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console


Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file:

.. code-block:: fortran

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as


.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1


Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:


.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>


Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:


.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran:


.. code-block:: text


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML:


.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies
----------------------------------------

.. index:: figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of flow by streamtubes*


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200




.. index:: movies


Test of movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Movie :ref:`mov:tsunami` shows a tsunami.

.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) .</em></p>



Test empty caption (for inline movie):

.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em></em></p>



.. Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption


.. raw:: html
        
        <p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
        <em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).</em></p>



.. Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the

.. embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo.


.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.</em>
        



.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>
        




.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


.. Test URL as figure name



.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:


.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        


Or with align with label and numbers:


.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        



.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        


Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------


.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible


.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible


.. index::
   single: index with; subindex


.. index with comma could fool sphinx


.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more


Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads

.. code-block:: text


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

================  ================  ================  ================  
   :math:`i`        :math:`h_i`     :math:`\bar T_i`      ``L_i``       
================  ================  ================  ================  
0                                0               288           -0.0065  
1                           11,000               216               0.0  
2                           20,000               216             0.001  
3                           32,000               228            0.0028  
4                           47,000               270               0.0  
5                           51,000               270           -0.0028  
6                           71,000               214           ``NaN``  
================  ================  ================  ================  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right after verbatim word (with no space):

=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
        exact                 ``v_1``         :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``       ``verb_3_``       
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
                    9                   9.62                   5.57                   8.98  
                  -20                 -23.39                  -7.65                 -19.93  
                   10                  17.74                  -4.50                   9.96  
                    0                  -9.19                   4.13                  -0.26  
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript :math:`a_i`: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Files ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is
some text.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

**Solution.**
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

**b)**
State some other problem.

**Hint 1.**
A hint can be given.

**Hint 2.**
Maybe even another hint?

**Solution.**
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        



And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. math::
   :label: eq1
        
        a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        



.. math::
   :label: eq2
          
        b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Testing split:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

We can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

Testing gather:

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


Testing alignat:

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2` again, and to the
alignat variant :eq:`eq1a`-:eq:`eq2a`, and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Testing eqnarray:

.. math::
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
        


More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in
between there we have :ref:`exer:some:formula`.

Exercises

.. _demo:ex:1:

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------
.. keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation


.. Torture tests


Make a program that simulates flipping a coin :math:`N` times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


.. Test syntax error





Remarks  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Use ``r = random.random()`` and define head as ``r <= 0.5``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among :math:`\{1,2\}` with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---


.. --- begin answer of exercise ---
**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number :math:`<1/2`, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this :math:`N` number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---
**Solution.**
Code:

.. code-block:: python

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _demo:ex:2:

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval :math:`[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw :math:`N` such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, :math:`M`, that fall in the interval :math:`(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as :math:`M/N`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- end exercise ---




.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by


.. math::
        
        x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
        



.. math::
          
        y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        

where :math:`R` is the radius of the circle, :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and :math:`t` is a parameter in the unit interval :math:`[0,1]`.
For any :math:`t`, :math:`(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle:


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw :math:`N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
:math:`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``

and then just the subroutine,

        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


==== Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in `t_{i+1}`. (myfig)

<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

==== The `\theta` parameter (not `\nabla`?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving `\theta`:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

*More on `\theta`.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
`\frac{1}{2}`, `{1/2}`, `\pmb{x}`, `\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



*Theorem 5.* Let `a=1` and `b=2`. Then `c=3`.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
*Proof.* Since `c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
`END`
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  1.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  3.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


 ||     _`i`_       ||    _`h_i`_      ||  _`\bar T_i`_   ||    _`L_i`_      ||
 ||  0              ||  0              ||  288            ||  -0.0065        ||
 ||  1              ||  11,000         ||  216            ||  0.0            ||
 ||  2              ||  20,000         ||  216            ||  0.001          ||
 ||  3              ||  32,000         ||  228            ||  0.0028         ||
 ||  4              ||  47,000         ||  270            ||  0.0            ||
 ||  5              ||  51,000         ||  270            ||  -0.0028        ||
 ||  6              ||  71,000         ||  214            ||  `NaN`          ||


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right after verbatim word (with no space):


 ||      *exact*       ||      _`v_1`_       ||  _`a_i` + `v_2`_   ||    _`verb_3_`_     ||
 ||  9                 ||  9.62              ||  5.57              ||  8.98              ||
 ||  -20               ||  -23.39            ||  -7.65             ||  -19.93            ||
 ||  10                ||  17.74             ||  -4.50             ||  9.96              ||
 ||  0                 ||  -9.19             ||  4.13              ||  -0.26             ||



==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript `a_i`: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` ====

*Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math `a_{i-1}`.* Here is
some text.

==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also `file:///` works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no `hpl@simula.no`], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py `decay_mod`].

<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_3:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_4:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_9:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_gwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_8:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].

==== Project 3: Compute a Probability ====

<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval `[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:


# item1
# item2

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw `N` such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, `M`, that fall in the interval `(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as `M/N`.

==== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where `R` is the radius of the circle, `(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and `t` is a parameter in the unit interval `[0,1]`.
For any `t`, `(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw `N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.


*a)* Let `R` be normally distributed and `(x_0,y_0)` uniformly distributed.

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


==== Appendix: Testing inline comments ====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl:
not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  ===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<!-- !split -->




The format of this document is
mwiki

''Abstract.'' This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

== Section 1 ==


Here is a nested list:


<ul>
  <li> item1
  <li> item2
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  <li> and a sublist

<ul>
    <li><li> with indented subitem1
    <li><li> and a subitem2
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist

<ol>
   <li><li> first item
   <li><li> second item,
      continuing on a new line
</ol>

</ul>





Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

==== Subsection 1 ====

More text, with a reference back to the section [#Section_1] and further
to the section [#URLs]. 
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and then just the subroutine,
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and finally the complete file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>

Testing other code environments. First Python:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which gets rendered as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x+1
</syntaxhighlight>

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
</syntaxhighlight>

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
</syntaxhighlight>


Then Cython:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:
<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp">
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
</syntaxhighlight>
<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which then is typeset as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</syntaxhighlight>

HTML:

<syntaxhighlight lang="html5">
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
</syntaxhighlight>

System call:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
</syntaxhighlight>

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


==== Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.


[[File:Streamtubes.png|frame|200px|alt=Streamtubes.png|Visualization of flow by streamtubes. (fig:impact)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


[[File:Streamtubes.png|frame|200px|alt=Streamtubes.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->



==== Test of movies ====

Movie mov:tsunami shows a tsunami.

 Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) . (Movie <code>../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg</code>: play mjolnir.html)

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

 (Movie <code>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg</code>: play wavepacket.html)

<!-- Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption -->


 Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).   (Movie of files <code>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</code> in wavepacket_0001.html)


<!-- Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the -->
<!-- embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo. -->

 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU

 Computational fluid dynamics movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330


<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


[[File:Wavepacket 0001.png|frame|500px|alt=Wavepacket 0001.png|A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in <math>t_{i+1}</math>. (myfig)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<!-- Test URL as figure name -->


[[File:f_plot.png|frame|500,px|link=https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog|alt=f_plot.png|<span title=""></span>]]


<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

    [[File:Df plot.png|frame|800px|alt=Df plot.png|This is a wikimedia figure file.]] <!-- user: Hplwp, filename: df_plot.png, timestamp: 2013-01-10T11:37:05Z -->


<!-- Non-uploaded file with no caption -->

[[File:Df2s8765s plot.png|frame|200,px|alt=Df2s8765s plot.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

==== The <math>\theta</math> parameter (not <math>\nabla</math>?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving <math>\theta</math>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</syntaxhighlight>

''More on <math>\theta</math>.''
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
<math>\frac{1}{2}</math>, <math>{1/2}</math>, <math>\pmb{x}</math>, <math>\frac{Du}{dt}</math>,
both inline and in block:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

Or with align with label and numbers:

:<math>
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align}
</math>

The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.

==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->



''Theorem 5.''
Let <math>a=1</math> and <math>b=2</math>. Then <math>c=3</math>.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
''Proof.''
Since <math>c=a+b</math>, the result follows from straightforward addition.
<math>\Diamond</math>
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:


<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>

The Doconce source code reads
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</syntaxhighlight>

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     <math>i</math>    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    <math>h_i</math>   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <math>\bar T_i</math> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    <code>L_i</code>   </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0                        </td> <td align="right">   0                        </td> <td align="right">   288                      </td> <td align="right">   -0.0065                  </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1                        </td> <td align="right">   11,000                   </td> <td align="right">   216                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0                      </td> </tr>

==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript <math>a_i</math>: <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> ====

''Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math <math>a_{i-1}</math>.''
Here is
some text.

==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


''a)''
State some problem.

''Solution.''
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

''b)''
State some other problem.

''Hint 1.''
A hint can be given.

''Hint 2.''
Maybe even another hint?

''Solution.''
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also <code>file:///</code> works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no <code>hpl@simula.no</code>], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py <code>decay_mod</code>].

<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
:<math>
 a = b + c 
</math>
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
:<math>
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u </math>
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
:<math>
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
</math>



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_3:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_4:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_9:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_mwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_8:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].

== Exercises ==



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Problem 2: Flip a Coin ====

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin <math>N</math> times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


<!-- Test syntax error -->




==== Remarks ====

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list


<ol>
<li> Mark 1.
<li> Mark 2.
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 1.''
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 2.''
Draw an integer among <math>\{1,2\}</math> with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number <math><1/2</math>, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this <math>N</math> number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
Code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->
Filenames: <code>flip_coin.py</code>, <code>flip_coin.pdf</code>.
<!-- solution files: mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


==== Not an exercise ====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 3: Compute a Probability ====

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval <math>[0,1)</math>?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw <math>N</math> such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, <math>M</math>, that fall in the interval <math>(0.5,0.6)</math>, and
compute the probability as <math>M/N</math>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

:<math>
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
</math>
where <math>R</math> is the radius of the circle, <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> is the
center point, and <math>t</math> is a parameter in the unit interval <math>[0,1]</math>.
For any <math>t</math>, <math>(x,y)</math> is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw <math>N</math> circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the <code>circle</code> function
above.


''a)''
Let <math>R</math> be normally distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
Use the <code>numpy.random</code> module to draw the
<math>x_0</math>, <math>y_0</math>, and <math>R</math> quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

''b)''
Let <math>R</math> be uniformly distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> normally distributed.
Filename: <code>norm.py</code>.

''c)''
Let <math>R</math> and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> be normally distributed.

professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


==== Appendix: Testing inline comments ====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
<math>\partial u/\partial t</math>, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

==== Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> ====

The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

The format of this document is
cwiki

//Abstract.// This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<wiki:comment> Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> is mutually exclusive in LaTeX </wiki:comment>

= Section 1 =


Here is a nested list:


  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist

    ** with indented subitem1
    //* and a subitem2


  // and perhaps an ordered sublist

   ## first item
   ## second item,      continuing on a new line







Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

<wiki:comment> !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment </wiki:comment>

== Subsection 1 ==

More text, with a reference back to the section [#Section_1] and further
to the section [#URLs]. 
<wiki:comment> sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console </wiki:comment>

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

{{{
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}
and then just the subroutine,
{{{

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}
and finally the complete file:
{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
{{{
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
}}}
which gets rendered as

{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

{{{
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

It is time to test {{{verbatim inline font}}} especially with {{{a newline
inside the text}}} and an exclamation mark at the end: {{{BEGIN}}}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the {{{Verb}}} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test {{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}} as well as {{{!bsummary}}}.
Also test backslashes and braces like {{{\begin}}}, {{{\begin{enumerate}}}},
{{{\end{this}\end{that}}}}, and {{{{something \inside braces}}}} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


== Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies ==


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

{{../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png| Visualization of flow by streamtubes. (fig:impact)}}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

{{../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png|}}


=== Test of movies ===

Movie mov:tsunami shows a tsunami.

 Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) . (Movie {{{../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg}}}: play [[mjolnir.html]])

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

 (Movie {{{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg}}}: play [[wavepacket.html]])

<wiki:comment> Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption </wiki:comment>


 Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).   (Movie of files {{{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png}}} in [[wavepacket_0001.html]])


<wiki:comment> Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo. </wiki:comment>

 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU]]

 Computational fluid dynamics movie. [[http://vimeo.com/55562330]]


<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

{{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png| A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like {{{my_file_v1}}} and {{{my_file_v2}}} as well as math with subscript as in {{{t_{i+1}}}}. (myfig) }}

<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Test URL as figure name </wiki:comment>

{{https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png|}}

<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

== The {{{\theta}}} parameter (not {{{\nabla}}}?) ==


Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving {{{\theta}}}:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

//More on {{{\theta}}}.// Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
{{{\frac{1}{2}}}}, {{{{1/2}}}}, {{{\pmb{x}}}}, {{{\frac{Du}{dt}}}},
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


== Custom Environments ==

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {{{.tex}}} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



//Theorem 5.// Let {{{a=1}}} and {{{b=2}}}. Then {{{c=3}}}.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
//Proof.// Since {{{c=a+b}}}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


== Tables ==



<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  4.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  1.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  3.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


 | ={{{i}}}            | ={{{h_i}}}          | ={{{\bar T_i}}}     | ={{{L_i}}}          |
 |  0                  |  0                  |  288                |  -0.0065            |
 |  1                  |  11,000             |  216                |  0.0                |
 |  2                  |  20,000             |  216                |  0.001              |
 |  3                  |  32,000             |  228                |  0.0028             |
 |  4                  |  47,000             |  270                |  0.0                |
 |  5                  |  51,000             |  270                |  -0.0028            |
 |  6                  |  71,000             |  214                |  {{{NaN}}}          |


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with {{{|-}}} because of a negative number,
and {{{|}}} right after verbatim word (with no space):


 | =exact                     | ={{{v_1}}}                 | ={{{a_i}}} + {{{v_2}}}     | ={{{verb_3_}}}             |
 |  9                         |  9.62                      |  5.57                      |  8.98                      |
 |  -20                       |  -23.39                    |  -7.65                     |  -19.93                    |
 |  10                        |  17.74                     |  -4.50                     |  9.96                      |
 |  0                         |  -9.19                     |  4.13                      |  -0.26                     |



== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript {{{a_i}}}: {{{my_file_v1}}} and {{{my_file_v2}}} ==

//Files {{{my_file_v1.py}}} and {{{my_file_v2.py}}} define some math {{{a_{i-1}}}}.// Here is
some text.

== Bibliography test ==

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




<wiki:comment> --- begin exercise --- </wiki:comment>

== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ==


Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with {{{Example:}}}
and then, with the command-line option {{{--examples_as_exercises}}} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


//a)// State some problem.

//Solution.// The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

//b)// State some other problem.

//Hint 1.// A hint can be given.

//Hint 2.// Maybe even another hint?

//Solution.// The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<wiki:comment> --- end exercise --- </wiki:comment>


== URLs ==


Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]], or
the entire URL if desired, [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]].  Here is a
plain file link [[testdoc.do.txt]], or [[testdoc.do.txt]], or
[[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt|a link with
newline]]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]] or [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]]. Also {{{file:///}}} works: [[file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html|link to a
file]] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]], if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|{{{hpl@simula.no}}}]], or just a [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|mail link]], or a raw [[mailto:hpl@simula.no]].

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the {{{latex}}} format:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas|Newton-Cotes]] formulas
and a [[http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1|good book]]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas]]
and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae]] which has a shebang.

For the {{{--device=paper}}} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
[[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py|{{{decay_mod}}}]].

<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a {{{_static*}}} folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
{{{--device=paper}}} option must be correct. We have
[[http://google.com|google]], [[http://google.com|google]], and
[[http://google.com|google]], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_3:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_4:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_9:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_cwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_8:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].

== Project 3: Compute a Probability ==


<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval {{{[0,1)}}}?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:


# item1
# item2

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

//Hint.// To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw {{{N}}} such random numbers using Python's standard {{{random}}} module,
count how many of them, {{{M}}}, that fall in the interval {{{(0.5,0.6)}}}, and
compute the probability as {{{M/N}}}.

== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ==


The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where {{{R}}} is the radius of the circle, {{{(x_0,y_0)}}} is the
center point, and {{{t}}} is a parameter in the unit interval {{{[0,1]}}}.
For any {{{t}}}, {{{(x,y)}}} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {{{n}}} points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw {{{N}}} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the {{{circle}}} function
above.

//Tip.// 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [[http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/|Script for Introduction to Version Control]] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [[http://dropbox.com|Dropbox]] and [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


== Appendix: Testing inline comments ==

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to [[http://dropbox.com]] and watch the video. It explains
how files, like {{{myfile.py}}}, perhaps containing much math, like
{{{\partial u/\partial t}}}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

== Appendix: Testing headings ending with {{{verbatim inline}}} ==

The point here is to test 1) {{{verbatim}}} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

The format of this document is
st
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.



Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line






Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

Subsection 1

More text, with a reference back to the section "Section 1" and further
to the section "URLs". 

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test 'verbatim inline font' especially with 'a newline
inside the text' and an exclamation mark at the end: 'BEGIN'! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the 'Verb' typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test '!bc' and '!ec' as well as '!bsummary'.
Also test backslashes and braces like '\begin', '\begin{enumerate}',
'\end{this}\end{that}', and '{something \inside braces}' in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more. Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the '.tex' by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.* Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

========  ========  ========  ========  
   i        h_i     \bar T_i   'L_i'    
========  ========  ========  ========  
0                0       288   -0.0065  
1           11,000       216       0.0  
2           20,000       216     0.001  
3           32,000       228    0.0028  
4           47,000       270       0.0  
5           51,000       270   -0.0028  
6           71,000       214     'NaN'  
========  ========  ========  ========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with '|-' because of a negative number,
and '|' right after verbatim word (with no space):

===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
   exact        'v_1'     a_i + 'v_2'   'verb_3_'   
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
          9         9.62         5.57         8.98  
        -20       -23.39        -7.65       -19.93  
         10        17.74        -4.50         9.96  
          0        -9.19         4.13        -0.26  
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: 'my_file_v1' and 'my_file_v2'

*Files 'my_file_v1.py' and 'my_file_v2.py' define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is
some text.

Bibliography test

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with 'Example:'
and then, with the command-line option '--examples_as_exercises' be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

URLs

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl, or
the entire URL if desired, "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or
"testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":a link with
newline. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl or "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl. Also 'file:///' works: "file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html":link to a
file is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: mailto:hpl@simula.no:'hpl@simula.no', or just a "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mail link, or a raw "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the 'latex' format:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":Newton-Cotes formulas
and a "http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1":good book. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the '--device=paper' option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py:'decay_mod'.



More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
'--device=paper' option must be correct. We have
"http://google.com":google, "http://google.com":google, and
"http://google.com":google, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for st", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises



# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.






Remarks

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 1.* Use 'r = random.random()' and define head as 'r <= 0.5'.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
'r = random.randint(1,2)' and define head when 'r' is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* If the 'random.random()' function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)


# --- end solution of exercise ---
Filenames: 'flip_coin.py', 'flip_coin.pdf'.

Not an exercise

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



# --- begin exercise ---

Project 3: Compute a Probability



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard 'random' module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---




# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate 'n' points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the 'circle' function
above.


*a)* Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* Use the 'numpy.random' module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)* Let R be uniformly distributed and (x_0,y_0) normally distributed.
Filename: 'norm.py'.

*c)* Let R and (x_0,y_0) be normally distributed.

At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives.

Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/":Script for Introduction to Version Control provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "http://dropbox.com":Dropbox and "http://drive.google.com":Google Drive.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to "http://dropbox.com":http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like 'myfile.py', perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with 'verbatim inline'

The point here is to test 1) 'verbatim' code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

The format of this document is
epytext

I{Abstract.} This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.



Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line






Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

Subsection 1
------------

More text, with a reference back to the section "Section 1" and further
to the section "URLs". 

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test C{verbatim inline font} especially with C{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: C{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the C{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test C{!bc} and C{!ec} as well as C{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like C{\begin}, C{\begin{enumerate}},
C{\end{this}\end{that}}, and C{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more. Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies
----------------------------------------


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200] Visualization of flow by streamtubes. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200]


Test of movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Movie ref{mov:tsunami} shows a tsunami.

 Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) . (Movie C{../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg}: play U{mjolnir.html<mjolnir.html>})

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

 (Movie C{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg}: play U{wavepacket.html<wavepacket.html>})



 Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).   (Movie of files C{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png} in U{wavepacket_0001.html<wavepacket_0001.html>})



 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link. U{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU>}

 Computational fluid dynamics movie. U{http://vimeo.com/55562330<http://vimeo.com/55562330>}



Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2} as well as math with subscript as in M{t_{i+1}}. {myfig} 



FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]



The M{\theta} parameter (not M{\nabla}?)
----------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving M{\theta}::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


I{More on M{\theta}.} Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
M{\frac{1}{2}}, M{{1/2}}, M{\pmb{x}}, M{\frac{Du}{dt}},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the C{.tex} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




I{Theorem 5.} Let M{a=1} and M{b=2}. Then M{c=3}.

I{Proof.} Since M{c=a+b}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
M{END}

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
    M{i}        M{h_i}    M{\bar T_i}     C{L_i}    
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
0                      0          288      -0.0065  
1                 11,000          216          0.0  
2                 20,000          216        0.001  
3                 32,000          228       0.0028  
4                 47,000          270          0.0  
5                 51,000          270      -0.0028  
6                 71,000          214       C{NaN}  
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with C{|-} because of a negative number,
and C{|} right after verbatim word (with no space):

===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  
     exact            C{v_1}      M{a_i} + C{v_2}     C{verb_3_}    
===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  
              9             9.62             5.57             8.98  
            -20           -23.39            -7.65           -19.93  
             10            17.74            -4.50             9.96  
              0            -9.19             4.13            -0.26  
===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript M{a_i}: C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I{Files C{my_file_v1.py} and C{my_file_v2.py} define some math M{a_{i-1}}.} Here is
some text.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with C{Example:}
and then, with the command-line option C{--examples_as_exercises} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


I{a)} State some problem.

I{Solution.} The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

I{b)} State some other problem.

I{Hint 1.} A hint can be given.

I{Hint 2.} Maybe even another hint?

I{Solution.} The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, or
the entire URL if desired, U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.  Here is a
plain file link U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or
U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{a link with
newline<testdoc.do.txt>}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>} or U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}. Also C{file:///} works: U{link to a
file<file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: U{C{hpl@simula.no}<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or just a U{mail link<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or a raw U{mailto:hpl@simula.no<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the C{latex} format:
U{Newton-Cotes<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>} formulas
and a U{good book<http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>}
and U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>} which has a shebang.

For the C{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
U{C{decay_mod}<https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>}.



More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
C{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
U{google<http://google.com>}, U{google<http://google.com>}, and
U{google<http://google.com>}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.





More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for epytext", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises
=========



# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin M{N} times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.






Remarks
~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint 1.} Use C{r = random.random()} and define head as C{r <= 0.5}.

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval M{[0,1)}?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.} To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw M{N} such random numbers using Python's standard C{random} module,
count how many of them, M{M}, that fall in the interval M{(0.5,0.6)}, and
compute the probability as M{M/N}.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where M{R} is the radius of the circle, M{(x_0,y_0)} is the
center point, and M{t} is a parameter in the unit interval M{[0,1]}.
For any M{t}, M{(x,y)} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate C{n} points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw M{N} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the C{circle} function
above.


I{a)} Let M{R} be normally distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.} Use the C{numpy.random} module to draw the
M{x_0}, M{y_0}, and M{R} quantities.

I{Tip.} 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent U{Script for Introduction to Version Control<http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are U{Dropbox<http://dropbox.com>} and U{Google Drive<http://drive.google.com>}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to U{http://dropbox.com<http://dropbox.com>} and watch the video. It explains
how files, like C{myfile.py}, perhaps containing much math, like
M{\partial u/\partial t}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with C{verbatim inline}
---------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) C{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

The format of this document is
plain

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.


Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line






Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

Subsection 1
------------

More text, with a reference back to the section "Section 1" and further
to the section "URLs". 

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test verbatim inline font especially with a newline
inside the text and an exclamation mark at the end: BEGIN! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the Verb typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test !bc and !ec as well as !bsummary.
Also test backslashes and braces like \begin, \begin{enumerate},
\end{this}\end{that}, and {something \inside braces} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more. Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies
----------------------------------------


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200] Visualization of flow by streamtubes. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200]


Test of movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Movie ref{mov:tsunami} shows a tsunami.

 Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) . (Movie ../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)

Test empty caption (for inline movie):

 (Movie ../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg: play wavepacket.html)



 Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).   (Movie of files ../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png in wavepacket_0001.html)



 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU

 Computational fluid dynamics movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330



Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like my_file_v1 and my_file_v2 as well as math with subscript as in t_{i+1}. {myfig} 



FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]



The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)
----------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the .tex by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.* Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

========  ========  ========  ========  
   i        h_i     \bar T_i    L_i     
========  ========  ========  ========  
0                0       288   -0.0065  
1           11,000       216       0.0  
2           20,000       216     0.001  
3           32,000       228    0.0028  
4           47,000       270       0.0  
5           51,000       270   -0.0028  
6           71,000       214       NaN  
========  ========  ========  ========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with |- because of a negative number,
and | right after verbatim word (with no space):

=========  =========  =========  =========  
  exact       v_1     a_i + v_2   verb_3_   
=========  =========  =========  =========  
        9       9.62       5.57       8.98  
      -20     -23.39      -7.65     -19.93  
       10      17.74      -4.50       9.96  
        0      -9.19       4.13      -0.26  
=========  =========  =========  =========  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: my_file_v1 and my_file_v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Files my_file_v1.py and my_file_v2.py define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is
some text.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




# --- begin exercise ---

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with Example:
and then, with the command-line option --examples_as_exercises be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or a link with
newline (testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also file:/// works: link to a
file (file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: hpl@simula.no (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a mail link (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the latex format:
Newton-Cotes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a good book (http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the --device=paper option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
decay_mod (https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py).



More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
--device=paper option must be correct. We have
google (http://google.com), google (http://google.com), and
google (http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for plain", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises
=========



# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.






Remarks
~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 1.* Use r = random.random() and define head as r <= 0.5.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
r = random.randint(1,2) and define head when r is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* If the random.random() function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)


# --- end solution of exercise ---

Not an exercise
---------------

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



# --- begin exercise ---

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard random module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---




# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate n points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the circle function
above.


*a)* Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* Use the numpy.random module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)* Let R be uniformly distributed and (x_0,y_0) normally distributed.
Filename: norm.py.

*c)* Let R and (x_0,y_0) be normally distributed.

Filename: circles.pdf.

At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent Script for Introduction to Version Control (http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are Dropbox (http://dropbox.com) and Google Drive (http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like myfile.py, perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with verbatim inline
------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) verbatim code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<!-- Table of contents: Run pandoc with --toc option -->



<!-- !split -->




The format of this document is
pandoc
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->



## Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line


> Here are two lines that make up
> a block quote.



Here is a reference to Equation \eqref{my:eq1}.

<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

### Subsection 1

More text, with a reference back to the section [Section 1](#n-1) and further
to the section [URLs](#s). 
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then just the subroutine,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and finally the complete file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing other code environments. First Python:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which gets rendered as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then Cython:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which then is typeset as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTML:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System call:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


### Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

![Visualization of flow by streamtubes. ](../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png)

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

![](../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png)


#### Test of movies

Movie ref{mov:tsunami} shows a tsunami.


<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) .</em></p>


Test empty caption (for inline movie):


<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em></em></p>


<!-- Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption -->


<p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
<em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).</em></p>

<!-- Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the -->
<!-- embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo. -->


<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.</em>




<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>




<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

![A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. ](../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png)

<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<!-- Test URL as figure name -->

![](https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png)

<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

### The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*More on $\theta$.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$\frac{1}{2}$, ${1/2}$, $\pmb{x}$, $\frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

$$

\frac{Du}{dt} = 0


$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}

$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

$$

Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
\label{aligneq1}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{equation}
$$


### Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->

*Theorem 5.* Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
*Proof.* Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


### Tables


<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:



    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  



The Doconce source code reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


   $i$        $h_i$     $\bar T_i$    `L_i`     
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  
0                    0         288     -0.0065  
1               11,000         216         0.0  
2               20,000         216       0.001  
3               32,000         228      0.0028  
4               47,000         270         0.0  
5               51,000         270     -0.0028  
6               71,000         214       `NaN`  


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right after verbatim word (with no space):


    exact          `v_1`      $a_i$ + `v_2`    `verb_3_`    
-------------  -------------  -------------  -------------  
            9           9.62           5.57           8.98  
          -20         -23.39          -7.65         -19.93  
           10          17.74          -4.50           9.96  
            0          -9.19           4.13          -0.26  



### A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`

*Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.* Here is
some text.

### Bibliography test

Here is an example: @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, @Langtangen_et_al_2002 gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in @Langtangen_1994a.
The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002;@Mardal_et_al_2003a.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
@Langtangen_1992c;@Langtangen_1994a;@Mortensen_et_al_2011;@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002
and
@Langtangen_et_al_2002;@Glimsdal_et_al_20006;@Rahman_et_al_2006b;@Haga_et_al_2011a;@Langtangen_2003a;@Langtangen_2008a;@Langtangen:95
and all the work of
@Langtangen_2012;@Mardal_et_al_2003a;@Jeberg_et_al_2004 as well as
old work @Langtangen_1988d and @Langtangen_1989e, and the
talk @Langtangen_talk_2007a.
Langtangen also had two thesis @Langtangen:85;@Langtangen_1989e.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book @Langtangen:91 and the
@Langtangen:94b OONSKI '94 paper.




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


### URLs

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>.  Here is a
plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>, or
<testdoc.do.txt> or <testdoc.do.txt> or [a link with
newline](testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also `file:///` works: [link to a
file](file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [`hpl@simula.no`](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a [mail link](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw <mailto:hpl@simula.no>.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[Newton-Cotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a [good book](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>
and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae> which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
[`decay_mod`](https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py).

<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[google](http://google.com), [google](http://google.com), and
[google](http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



### LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$
 a = b + c 
$$
or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$

\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} 

$$

$$
  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v

$$


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} 
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$
Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to the last equation by \eqref{split:envir:eq}.

Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$

Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$
Let us refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2} again, and to the
alignat variant \eqref{eq1a}-\eqref{eq2a}, and to \eqref{my:eq1}.

Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  [Problem 2: Flip a Coin](#n) and  [Project 3: Compute a Probability](#y),
as well as  [Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles](#s) and [Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for pandoc](#c), and in
between there we have  [Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems](#s).

## Exercises



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Problem 2: Flip a Coin

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


<!-- Test syntax error -->




#### Remarks

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 1.* Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.* If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.* Code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->
Filenames: `flip_coin.py`, `flip_coin.pdf`.
<!-- solution files: mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


### Not an exercise

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Project 3: Compute a Probability

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

### Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.


*a)* Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

*b)* Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
Filename: `norm.py`.

*c)* Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [Script for Introduction to Version Control](http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

*Summary.* 
_Bold remark:_ Make some text with this summary.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


### Appendix: Testing inline comments

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <http://dropbox.com> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

### Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline`

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>The format of this document is plain, homemade LaTeX (from Doconce).</p>
<p>This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax. It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.</p>
<p>And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which is part of the abstract.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">Section 1</h1>
<p>[sec1]</p>
<p>Here is a nested list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>item1</p></li>
<li><p>item2</p></li>
<li><p>item3 which continues on the next line to test that feature</p></li>
<li><p>and a sublist</p>
<ul>
<li><p>with indented subitem1</p></li>
<li><p>and a subitem2</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>and perhaps an ordered sublist</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>first item</p></li>
<li><p>second item, continuing on a new line</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are two lines that make up a block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a reference to Equation ([my:eq1]).</p>
<h2 id="subsection-1">Subsection 1</h2>
<p>More text, with a reference back to Section [sec1] and further to Section [subsubsec:ex].</p>
<p>Let’s do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,</p>
<pre><code>subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return</code></pre>
<p>and then just the subroutine,</p>
<pre><code>      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return</code></pre>
<p>and finally the complete file:</p>
<pre><code>C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return</code></pre>
<p>Testing other code environments. First Python:</p>
<pre><code>!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec</code></pre>
<p>which gets rendered as</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
    return x+1</code></pre>
<p>Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:</p>
<pre><code>class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&amp;mode=display&amp;cumulative=false&amp;heapPrimitives=false&amp;drawParentPointers=false&amp;textReferences=false&amp;py=2&amp;curInstr=0}">Visualize execution</a>)</p>
<p>Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but such cells are not supported by this format).</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel(&#39;x&#39;); ylabel(&#39;y&#39;)
show()</code></pre>
<p>Then Cython:</p>
<pre><code>cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1</code></pre>
<p>C++:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
   std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sample output&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   return 0
}</code></pre>
<p>And a little bit of Fortran:</p>
<pre><code>!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec</code></pre>
<p>which then is typeset as</p>
<pre><code>subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end</code></pre>
<p>HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Column 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Column 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.67526 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.92871 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<p>System call:</p>
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; mkdir test
Terminal&gt; cd test
Terminal&gt; myprog -f
output1
output2</code></pre>
<p>It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now be fixed: test  !bc  and  !ec  as well as  !bsummary . Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>, <code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline verbatim text.</p>
<p>Here is some color and an attempt to write Some formats will only display this correctly when HTML is the output format.</p>

<p>Here is an example: @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 discussed propagation of large destructive water waves, @Langtangen_et_al_2002 gave an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing random vibrations was investigated in @Langtangen_1994a. The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package. Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 [@Mardal_et_al_2003a].</p>
<p>We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting problem with blanks in the keys in reST format: @Langtangen_1992c [@Langtangen_1994a; @Mortensen_et_al_2011; @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002] and @Langtangen_et_al_2002 [@Glimsdal_et_al_20006; @Rahman_et_al_2006b; @Haga_et_al_2011a; @Langtangen_2003a; @Langtangen_2008a; @Langtangen:95] and all the work of @Langtangen_2012 [@Mardal_et_al_2003a; @Jeberg_et_al_2004] as well as old work @Langtangen_1988d and @Langtangen_1989e, and the talk @Langtangen_talk_2007a. Langtangen also had two thesis @Langtangen:85 [@Langtangen_1989e]. More retro citations are the old ME-IN323 book @Langtangen:91 and the @Langtangen:94b OONSKI ’94 paper.</p>
<h2 id="example-1-examples-can-be-typeset-as-exercises">Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises</h2>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>[subsubsec:ex]</p>
<p>Testing of URLs: hpl’s home page <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a>, or the entire URL if desired, <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}"></a>. Here is a plain file link <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a>, or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a>, or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a> or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a> or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}">a link with newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word too: <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a> or <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}">link to a file</a> is fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just the plain URL as in <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}"></a>, if followed by space, comma, colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period (which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).</p>
<p>Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}"></a>, or just a <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}"></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format: <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonCotes_formulas}">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas and a <a href="{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+scienceengineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}">good book</a>. Need to test Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too: <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonCotes_formulas}"></a> and <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}"></a> which has a shebang.</p>
<p>For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to <a href="{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}"></a>.</p>
<p>More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the <code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, and <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, which should result in exactly three footnotes.</p>

<p>Let’s check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e. expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen, or maybe also prof. Ting, will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. [subsubsec:ex] or Ch. [subsubsec:ex], or even App. [subsubsec:ex], must also be handled. Likewise, this is test no. <span class="math">\(i\)</span> of Doconce features. A sentence containing &quot;refines lines&quot; could easily fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything. Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. [mytab].</p>

<p>Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment: <span class="math">\[a = b + c\]</span> or with number and label, as in ([my:eq1]), using the equation environment:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to this equation by ([my:eq1]).</p>
<p>Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\pmb{a} &amp;= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
a &amp;= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to ([eq1])-([eq2]). They are a bit simpler than the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>. Also test <span class="math">\(a_{i-j}\)</span> as well as <span class="math">\(kx-wt\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats. Testing multiline:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gathered}

<p>Testing split:</p>

\begin{split}
a = b = q &amp;+ \\ 
  &amp; f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to the last equation by ([split:envir:eq]).</p>
<p>Testing gather:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gathered}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9\end{gathered}\]</span></p>
<p>Testing alignat:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}

a &amp;= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad &amp; \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x &amp; x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Let us refer to ([eq1])-([eq2]) again, and to the alignat variant ([eq1a])-([eq2a]), and to ([my:eq1]).</p>
<p>Testing eqnarray:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p>[Tip.] Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.</p>
<p>Need a lot of text to surround the summary box. Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and share files among several computers and collaborators in a professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working with programs or technical reports it is essential to have changes documented and to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have the latest updates of the files. Greg Wilson’ excellent <a href="{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly from using version control systems.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site. I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other important files.</p>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="{http://dropbox.com}">Dropbox</a> and <a href="{http://drive.google.com}">Google Drive</a>. It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is challenging to find the right version from the past when there are so many of them.</p>
<p>More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control systems. The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</p>
<p>The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these files. Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and synchronize the files with the &quot;master version&quot; at the site where the project is hosted. If you at some point need to go back to a version of the files at some particular point in the past, this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see what various people have done with the files in the various versions.</p>
<p>All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps. The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings when you use version control systems every day. The point now is to get started.</p>

It explains how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like <span class="math">\(\partial u/\partial t\)</span>, are easily communicated between machines. * It is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share files among laptops and mobile units.</p>
<p>When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with true version control systems. <strong>hpl 3</strong>: * The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools. *</p>
<h2 id="appendix-testing-headings-ending-with-verbatim-inline">Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code></h2>
<p>The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2) ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special case in LaTeX.</p>

<p>The format of this document is pandoc <em>Abstract.</em> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax. It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.</p>
<p>And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which is part of the abstract.</p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->



<h2 id="section-1">Section 1</h2>

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
<p>C++:</p>

<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->

<p>It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>. Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>, <code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline verbatim text.</p>
<p>Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with green color containing a linebreak. And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when HTML is the output format.</p>

<h3 id="custom-environments">Custom Environments</h3>
<p>Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako (for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems. Should look nice in most formats!</p>
<!-- begin theorem -->

<p><em>Theorem 5.</em> Let <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b=2\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(c=3\)</span>. <!-- end theorem --></p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<p><em>Proof.</em> Since <span class="math">\(c=a+b\)</span>, the result follows from straightforward addition. <span class="math">\(\Diamond\)</span> <!-- end proof --></p>
<p>As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest achievement.</p>

The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package. Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002;@Mardal_et_al_2003a.</p>
<p>We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting problem with blanks in the keys in reST format: @Langtangen_1992c;@Langtangen_1994a;@Mortensen_et_al_2011;@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 and @Langtangen_et_al_2002;@Glimsdal_et_al_20006;@Rahman_et_al_2006b;@Haga_et_al_2011a;@Langtangen_2003a;@Langtangen_2008a;@Langtangen:95 and all the work of @Langtangen_2012;@Mardal_et_al_2003a;@Jeberg_et_al_2004 as well as old work @Langtangen_1988d and @Langtangen_1989e, and the talk @Langtangen_talk_2007a. Langtangen also had two thesis @Langtangen:85;@Langtangen_1989e. More retro citations are the old ME-IN323 book @Langtangen:91 and the @Langtangen:94b OONSKI '94 paper.</p>

Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html">link to a file</a> is fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">http://folk.uio.no/hpl</a>, if followed by space, comma, colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period (which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).</p>

<p>For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py"><code>decay_mod</code></a>.</p>

<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. -->

<p>More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the <code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have <a href="http://google.com">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com">google</a>, and <a href="http://google.com">google</a>, which should result in exactly three footnotes.</p>

<p><em>Tip.</em> Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.</p>
<p>Need a lot of text to surround the summary box. Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and share files among several computers and collaborators in a professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working with programs or technical reports it is essential to have changes documented and to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have the latest updates of the files. Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly from using version control systems.</p>
<p><em>Summary.</em> <em>Bold remark:</em> Make some text with this summary. Much testing in this document, otherwise stupid content. Much testing in this document, otherwise stupid content.

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site. I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other important files.</p>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is challenging to find the right version from the past when there are so many of them.</p>
<p>More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control systems. The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</p>
<p>The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these files. Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and synchronize the files with the &quot;master version&quot; at the site where the project is hosted. If you at some point need to go back to a version of the files at some particular point in the past, this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see what various people have done with the files in the various versions.</p>
<p>All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps. The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings when you use version control systems every day. The point now is to get started.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site.

<p>The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com">http://dropbox.com</a> and watch the video. It explains how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like <span class="math">\(\partial u/\partial t\)</span>, are easily communicated between machines.] It is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share files among laptops and mobile units.</p>

************** File: html_template.do.txt *****************
DATE: today

===== This is a test of HTML templates =====

Note: When using HTML templates, the Doconce file cannot have a title
(to avoid generating a header). It should neither have an author.

======= This is a 7 heading =======

Here is some code:
!bc pycod
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
!ec

===== This is a 5 heading =====

The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: *title*, *date* and *main*,
where *main* will become the Doconce file (the main body of text),
*title* is the first heading in the Doconce file, and
*date* is extracted from the Doconce file (if present).

<h1>Generalized References <a name="genrefs"></a></h1>

<p>
Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, Doconce offers <em>generalized references</em> which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the <code>xr</code> package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the <code>xr</code> feature in LaTeX.

<p>
The syntax of generalized references reads
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">ref[internal][cite][external]
</pre></div>
<p>
If all <code>ref{label}</code> references in the text <code>internal</code> are references
to labels in the present document, the above <code>ref</code> command is replaced
by the text <code>internal</code>. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
If none of the two situations above applies, the <code>external</code>
text will be the output.

<p>
Here is an example on a specific generalized reference:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in &quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;: &quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot; in
the document &quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;: &quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include movies.
</pre></div>
<p>
This is renedered as follows:
As explained in
a <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" target="_self">section</a> in
the document <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html" target="_self">A Document for Testing Doconce</a>
<a href="#testdoc:12">[1]</a>, Doconce documents may include movies.

<p>
And here is another example with internal references only:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][][
the document *author1*].
</pre></div>
<p>
The text is rendered to "Generalized references are described in
the section <a href="#genrefs">Generalized References</a>."

<p>
<!-- We are testing chapter too to see if latex output then has -->
<!-- book style rather than article style. -->

<h1>Test of math  <a name="___sec1"></a></h1>

the xr feature in LaTeX.

The syntax of generalized references reads::


        ref[internal][cite][external]

If all ref{label} references in the text internal are references
to labels in the present document, the above ref command is replaced
by the text internal. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is latex or pdflatex one assumes that the references in internal
are to external documents declared by a comment line #
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is internal cite and the
LaTeX package xr is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
If none of the two situations above applies, the external
text will be the output.

Here is an example on a specific generalized reference::


        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2012":
        "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
        cite{testdoc:12}][a "section": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
        the document "A Document for Testing Doconce": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
        cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include movies.

This is renedered as follows:
As explained in
a section (http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex) in
the document A Document for Testing Doconce (http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html)
[1], Doconce documents may include movies.

And here is another example with internal references only::


        Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][][
        the document *author1*].

The text is rendered to "Generalized references are described in
the section "Generalized References"."

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "emacs" -->
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td><div class="linenodiv" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding-right: 10px"><pre style="line-height: 125%">1

    return theta**2
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\tag{1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "emacs" -->
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td><div class="linenodiv" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding-right: 10px"><pre style="line-height: 125%">1

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

<p>
<table border="1">

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\tag{6}
\end{multline}
$$

Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to the last equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-7">(7)</a>.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$


<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \tag{8} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \tag{9}
\end{alignat}
$$

Let us refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a> again, and to the
alignat variant <a href="#mjx-eqn-8">(8)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-9">(9)</a>, and to <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \tag{10}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \tag{11}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.
</div>


<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec35"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
\( \partial u/\partial t \), are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<h2>Section 1 <a name="sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here is a reference to Equation <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h3>Subsection 1  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
More text, with a reference back to the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and further
to the section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>. 


<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

and then just the subroutine,

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

<p>
Testing other code environments. First Python:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which gets rendered as

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x<span style="color: #666666">+1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

<p>

<iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"

</iframe>
<p>
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel(&#39;x&#39;); ylabel(&#39;y&#39;)
show()
</pre></div>
<p>
Then Cython:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">cpdef</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(double x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x <span style="color: #666666">+</span> <span style="color: #666666">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>

C++:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #BC7A00">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #B00040">int</span> main()
{
   std<span style="color: #666666">::</span>cout <span style="color: #666666">&lt;&lt;</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Sample output&quot;</span> <span style="color: #666666">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span style="color: #666666">::</span>endl;
   <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">0</span>
}
</pre></div>
<p>

And a little bit of Fortran:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which then is typeset as

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</pre></div>
<p>
HTML:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">&lt;table&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<h3>The $latex \theta$ parameter (not $latex \nabla$?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $latex \theta$:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on $latex \theta$.</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$latex \frac{1}{2}$, $latex {1/2}$, $latex \pmb{x}$, $latex \frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
 $



<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

 $

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>

<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let $latex a=1$ and $latex b=2$. Then $latex c=3$.


<p>

<b>Proof.</b>
Since $latex c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$latex latex \Diamond$


<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
<p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

<p>
<table border="1">

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_blank">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_blank">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_blank"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_blank"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>.

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

$latex  a = b + c  $


or with number and label, as in <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>, using the equation environment:

$latex 
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
 $


We can refer to this equation by <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

$latex 
\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n}  $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
 $



<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

$latex 
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6   $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
 $


We can refer to <b>(REF to equation eq1 not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2 not supported)</b>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test $latex a_{i-j}$ as well as $latex kx-wt$.

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u

\end{multline}

Testing split:

$latex 

\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
 $


We can refer to the last equation by <b>(REF to equation split:envir:eq not supported)</b>.

<p>
Testing gather:

\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}


<p>
Testing alignat:

\begin{alignat}{2}
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad  \mbox{for } q\geq 0   $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x  x\in\Omega 
\end{alignat}

Let us refer to <b>(REF to equation eq1 not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2 not supported)</b> again, and to the
alignat variant <b>(REF to equation eq1a not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2a not supported)</b>, and to <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:

\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
\end{eqnarray}


<p>
More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

<h3>Problem 2: Flip a Coin <a name="demo:ex:1"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/question_blue_on_white1.png" width=80 align="right">



<p>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $latex N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec14"></a></h4>

<p>
Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

<p>

<ol>
<li> Mark 1.</li>
<li> Mark 2.</li>
</ol>



<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Draw an integer among $latex \{1,2\}$ with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<p>

<b>Answer.</b>
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number $latex <1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $latex N$ number of times.

<p>

<b>Solution.</b>
Code:

<h3>Project 3: Compute a Probability <a name="demo:ex:2"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/question_blue_on_white1.png" width=80 align="right">


<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $latex [0,1)$?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2</li>
</ol>



<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $latex N$ such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, $latex M$, that fall in the interval $latex (0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $latex M/N$.

<h3>Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a></h3>

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>

$latex 
x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t, $

$latex  
y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
 $


where $latex R$ is the radius of the circle, $latex (x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $latex t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $latex [0,1]$.
For any $latex t$, $latex (x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<b>Solution.</b>
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec20"></a></h4>

<p>
Some final closing remarks, e.g., summarizing the main findings
and their implications in other problems can be made. These
remarks will appear at the end of the typeset exercise.

<h3>Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix  <a name="___sec21"></a></h3>

<p>
Just some text. And some math saying that $latex e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

<p>

$latex  \exp{(0)} = 1  $



<p>
And a test that the code <code>lambda x: x+2</code> is correctly placed here:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">lambda x: x+2
</pre></div>

<h3>Example 7: Just an example  <a name="___sec22"></a></h3>

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_blank">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec35"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 

<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>

 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 

<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
$latex \partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>

 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  

<font color="red">[<b>hpl 3</b>: <em>The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</em>]</font>

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<!-- Just a comment -->

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h2>Section 1 <a name="sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here is a reference to Equation \eqref{my:eq1}.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<p>
<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

<h3>Subsection 1  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
More text, with a reference back to the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and further
to the section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>. 
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>

<!-- code=fortran (from !bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span>

<p>
and then just the subroutine,
<p>

<!-- code=fortran (from !bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">      return</span>

<p>
and finally the complete file:

</pre></div>
<p>
Testing other code environments. First Python:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which gets rendered as

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x<span style="color: #666666">+1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

<p>

<iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"

</iframe>
<p>
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc pyscpro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel(&#39;x&#39;); ylabel(&#39;y&#39;)
show()
</pre></div>
<p>
Then Cython:
<p>

<!-- code=cython (from !bc cycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">cpdef</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(double x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x <span style="color: #666666">+</span> <span style="color: #666666">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:
<p>

<!-- code=c++ (from !bc cpppro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #BC7A00">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #B00040">int</span> main()

   std<span style="color: #666666">::</span>cout <span style="color: #666666">&lt;&lt;</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Sample output&quot;</span> <span style="color: #666666">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span style="color: #666666">::</span>endl;
   <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">0</span>
}
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which then is typeset as

<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc cod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</pre></div>
<p>
HTML:

<p>

<!-- code=html (from !bc htmlcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">&lt;table&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">&lt;/table&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
System call:
<p>

<!-- code=bash (from !bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; mkdir <span style="color: #008000">test</span>
Terminal&gt; <span style="color: #008000">cd test</span>
Terminal&gt; myprog -f
output1
output2
</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of flow by streamtubes. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<h4>Test of movies  <a name="___sec3"></a></h4>

<p>
Movie <a href="#mov:tsunami">mov:tsunami</a> shows a tsunami.

<p>

<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) <a name="mov:tsunami"></a>.</em></p>


<p>
Test empty caption (for inline movie):

<p>

<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em></em></p>


<p>
<!-- Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption -->

<p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
<em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie). <a name="mymov"></a></em></p>

<p>
<!-- Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the -->

<p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>

<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>



<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
<p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     \( i \)      </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    \( h_i \)     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  \( \bar T_i \)  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <code>L_i</code> </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0                   </td> <td align="right">   0                   </td> <td align="right">   288                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0065             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1                   </td> <td align="right">   11,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2                   </td> <td align="right">   20,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.001               </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3                   </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                   </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                   </td> <td align="right">   51,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   6                   </td> <td align="right">   71,000              </td> <td align="right">   214                 </td> <td align="right">   <code>NaN</code>    </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            exact             </b></td> <td align="center"><b>       <code>v_1</code>       </b></td> <td align="center"><b> \( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>     <code>verb_3_</code>     </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   9                               </td> <td align="right">   9.62                            </td> <td align="right">   5.57                            </td> <td align="right">   8.98                            </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   -20                             </td> <td align="right">   -23.39                          </td> <td align="right">   -7.65                           </td> <td align="right">   -19.93                          </td> </tr>

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$

Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to the last equation by \eqref{split:envir:eq}.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$


<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$

Let us refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2} again, and to the
alignat variant \eqref{eq1a}-\eqref{eq2a}, and to \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.
</div>


<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec35"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
\( \partial u/\partial t \), are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.

Here is a reference to Equation (\ref{my:eq1}).

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file:
\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

System call:
\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

It is time to test \code{verbatim inline font} especially with \code{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \code{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \code{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \code{!bc} and \code{!ec} as well as \code{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like \code{\begin}, \code{\begin{enumerate}},
\code{\end{this}\end{that}}, and \code{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.} Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.


\paragraph{Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies.}

$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\paragraph{Custom Environments.}
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \code{.tex} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\paragraph{Tables.}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\bccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{L\_i} } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\
5          & 51,000     & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6          & 71,000     & 214        & \code{NaN} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \code{|-} because of a negative number,
and \code{|} right after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{v\_1} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \code{v\_2} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{verb\_3\_} } \\
\hline

\hline

\noindent

Here is
some text.

\paragraph{Bibliography test.}
Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\begin{doconce:exercise}
\refstepcounter{doconce:exercise:counter}

\subsection{Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises}
\label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with \code{Example:}
and then, with the command-line option \code{--examples_as_exercises} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


\paragraph{a)}
State some problem.

\paragraph{Solution.}
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

\paragraph{b)}
State some other problem.

\paragraph{Hint 1.}
A hint can be given.

\paragraph{Hint 2.}
Maybe even another hint?

\paragraph{Solution.}
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

\end{doconce:exercise}
% --- end exercise ---


\paragraph{URLs.}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \code{file:///} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \code{latex} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \code{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \code{_static*} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\code{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\paragraph{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes.}
Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

\paragraph{{\LaTeX} Mathematics.}
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \code{CG-2}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project 3: Compute a Probability}
\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in {\LaTeX}
in previous Doconce versions:

\begin{enumerate}

% --- begin hint in exercise ---

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \code{random} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

\subsection*{Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \code{n} points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \code{circle} function
above.


\paragraph{a)}
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\paragraph{Appendix: Testing inline comments.}
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly

The point here is to test 1) \code{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

TITLE: How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
AUTHOR: HPL
DATE: today


This document is translated to the format _${FORMAT}_. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

__Test 1: Inline math.__ Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

__Test 2: A single equation without label.__ Here it is

!bt
\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]
!et

__Test 3: A single equation with label.__ Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
and as a three-line latex code:

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
This equation has label (ref{eq1b}).


__Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.__ Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et

__Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.__ We use align with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2b})-(ref{eq3b}).

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but Doconce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is

!bc rst
.. math::
   :label: eq2b

        u(t)=e^{-at}


.. math::
   :label: eq3b

        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}

!ec
# #endif

# #if FORMAT == "pandoc"
Original Pandoc-extended Markdown transformed to HTML via Pandoc
does not work with labels and multiple equations. `doconce md2html`
fixes the trouble by adding full support for MathJax and avoiding
that eqref references become empty.

One can write with align and labels in the Doconce document and get excellent
output in LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Markdown-based HTML. Without
`doconce md2html` one must accept that labeles have very limited support
compared to more advanced MathJax.
# #endif


__Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.__ Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

__Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.__ We use eqnarray with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2c})-(ref{eq3c})?
# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
No, unfortunately not.
Note: Doconce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code

!bc rst
.. math::

        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\
        v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
!ec
That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.
# #endif

__Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.__
We have

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using `\bm`:

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx", "pandoc", "ipynb")
Note: for the ${FORMAT} format, `\bm` was substituted by Doconce
to `\boldsymbol`.
# #endif

<p><em>Test 1: Inline math.</em> Here is a sentence contains the equation <span class="math">\(u(t)=e^{-at}\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Test 2: A single equation without label.</em> Here it is</p>

\]</span></p>
<p><em>Test 3: A single equation with label.</em> Here it is as a one-line latex code,</p>

!et</code></pre>
<p>looking like</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
\]</span> and as a three-line latex code:</p>
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}

<p>looking like</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
\]</span> This equation has label \eqref{eq1b}.</p>
<p><em>Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.</em> Only the align environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting multiple, aligned equations. The code reads</p>
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&amp;=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et</code></pre>
<p>and results in</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>u(t)=e^{-at}</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>v(t) - 1 = </p>
<p>$$</p>
<p><em>Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.</em> We use align with labels:</p>
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&amp;=e^{-at}
\label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;= \frac{du}{dt}
\label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et</code></pre>
<p>and results in</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{equation}  
v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{equation}
\]</span> We can refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2b}-\eqref{eq3b}.</p>
<p>Original Pandoc-extended Markdown transformed to HTML via Pandoc does not work with labels and multiple equations. <code>doconce md2html</code> fixes the trouble by adding full support for MathJax and avoiding that eqref references become empty.</p>
<p>One can write with align and labels in the Doconce document and get excellent output in LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Markdown-based HTML. Without <code>doconce md2html</code> one must accept that labeles have very limited support compared to more advanced MathJax.</p>
<p><em>Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.</em> Let us try the old eqnarray environment.</p>
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et</code></pre>
<p>and results in</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
\]</span></p>
<p><em>Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.</em> We use eqnarray with labels:</p>
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at}
\label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt}
\label{eq3c}

u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
\]</span> Can we refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2c}-\eqref{eq3c}?</p>
<p><em>Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.</em> We have</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
 \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,
\]</span> and <span class="math">\(\nabla\u (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n}\)</span> with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using <code>\bm</code>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
 \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,
\]</span> and <span class="math">\(\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note: for the pandoc format, <code>\bm</code> was substituted by Doconce to <code>\boldsymbol</code>.</p>

This document is translated to the format \textbf{pdflatex}. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

\paragraph{Test 1: Inline math.}
Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

\paragraph{Test 2: A single equation without label.}
Here it is

\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]

\paragraph{Test 3: A single equation with label.}
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
and as a three-line latex code:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
This equation has label (\ref{eq1b}).


\paragraph{Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.}
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than {\LaTeX} for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.}
We use align with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{align}
We can refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2b})-(\ref{eq3b}).




\paragraph{Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.}
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.}
We use eqnarray with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2c})-(\ref{eq3c})?

\paragraph{Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.}
We have

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using \code{\bm}:

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Author: HPL
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

This document is translated to the format **sphinx**. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

**Test 1: Inline math.**
Here is a sentence contains the equation :math:`u(t)=e^{-at}`.

**Test 2: A single equation without label.**
Here it is


.. math::
         u(t)=e^{-at} 


**Test 3: A single equation with label.**
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
        !et

looking like


.. math::
   :label: eq1
         u(t)=e^{-at} 

and as a three-line latex code:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{equation}
        u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
        \end{equation}
        !et

looking like


.. math::
   :label: eq1b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        

This equation has label :eq:`eq1b`.


**Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.**
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{align*}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        


**Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.**
We use align with
labels:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}
        label{eq2b}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3b}
        \end{align}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
   :label: eq2b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        



.. math::
   :label: eq3b
          
        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt} 
        

We can refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2b`-:eq:`eq3b`.

Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but Doconce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is


.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
           :label: eq2b
        
                u(t)=e^{-at}
        
        
        .. math::
           :label: eq3b
        
                v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}
        




**Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.**
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{eqnarray*}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
        


**Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.**
We use eqnarray with
labels:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}
        label{eq2c}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3c}
        \end{eqnarray}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt} 
        

Can we refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2c`-:eq:`eq3c`?
No, unfortunately not.
Note: Doconce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code


.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
        
                u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
                v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}

That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.

**Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.**
We have


.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = \nu\nabla^2\pmb{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\pmb{u} (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n}`
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using ``\bm``:


.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = \nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\boldsymbol{u} (\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\boldsymbol{n}`.

Note: for the sphinx format, ``\bm`` was substituted by Doconce
to ``\boldsymbol``.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,

Testing other code environments. First Python:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which gets rendered as

<p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

<p>

<p>
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc pyscpro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel(&#39;x&#39;); ylabel(&#39;y&#39;)
show()

<p>
Then Cython:
<p>

<!-- code=cython (from !bc cycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">cpdef</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(double x):

</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:
<p>

<!-- code=c++ (from !bc cpppro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #BC7A00">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

   <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">0</span>
}
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)

      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which then is typeset as

<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc cod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</pre></div>
<p>
HTML:

<p>

<!-- code=html (from !bc htmlcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">&lt;table&gt;</span>

<p>
System call:

output2
</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of flow by streamtubes. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<h4>Test of movies  <a name="___sec3"></a></h4>

<p>
Movie <a href="#mov:tsunami">mov:tsunami</a> shows a tsunami.

<p>

<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) <a name="mov:tsunami"></a>.</em></p>


<p>
Test empty caption (for inline movie):

<p>

<embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p><em></em></p>


<p>
<!-- Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption -->

<p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
<em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie). <a name="mymov"></a></em></p>

<p>
<!-- Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the -->
<!-- embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo. -->

<p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.</em>



<p>

<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>



<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>
</center>

<p>
<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\tag{1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
<p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     \( i \)      </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    \( h_i \)     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  \( \bar T_i \)  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <code>L_i</code> </b></td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   3                   </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                   </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            exact             </b></td> <td align="center"><b>       <code>v_1</code>       </b></td> <td align="center"><b> \( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>     <code>verb_3_</code>     </b></td> </tr>

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\tag{6}
\end{multline}
$$

Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to the last equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-7">(7)</a>.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$


<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \tag{8} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \tag{9}
\end{alignat}
$$

Let us refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a> again, and to the
alignat variant <a href="#mjx-eqn-8">(8)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-9">(9)</a>, and to <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \tag{10}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \tag{11}
\end{eqnarray}
$$


<p>
More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

<p>
Below, we have <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#demo:ex:2">Project 3: Compute a Probability</a>,

<h3>Project 3: Compute a Probability <a name="demo:ex:2"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2</li>
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<h3>Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a></h3>

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec35"></a></h3>

<!-- end inline comment -->
 I strongly

scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox.

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line



..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.



Here is a reference to Equation :ref:`(3.3) <Eq:my:eq1>`.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file:

                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as


.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1


Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:


.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>


Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:


.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran:


.. code-block:: text


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML:


.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak.
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when
HTML is the output format.

Subsection 2: Testing figures and movies
----------------------------------------

.. index:: figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of flow by streamtubes*


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200




.. index:: movies


Test of movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Movie :ref:`mov:tsunami` shows a tsunami.

.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em>Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal) .</em></p>



Test empty caption (for inline movie):

.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg" width=700 height=400 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p><em></em></p>



.. Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption


.. raw:: html
        
        <p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
        <em>Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).</em></p>



.. Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the

.. embed command that the YouTube page can generate. Similar for Vimeo.


.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_O7iUiftbKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.</em>
        



.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Computational fluid dynamics movie.</em>
        




.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


.. Test URL as figure name



.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:


.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        


Or with align with label and numbers:


.. _Eq:aligneq1:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        



.. _Eq:aligneq2:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        


Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------


.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible


.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible


.. index::
   single: index with; subindex


.. index with comma could fool sphinx


.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more


Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads

.. code-block:: text


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly) and verbatim heading and entry:

================  ================  ================  ================  
   :math:`i`        :math:`h_i`     :math:`\bar T_i`      ``L_i``       
================  ================  ================  ================  
0                                0               288           -0.0065  
1                           11,000               216               0.0  
2                           20,000               216             0.001  
3                           32,000               228            0.0028  
4                           47,000               270               0.0  
5                           51,000               270           -0.0028  
6                           71,000               214           ``NaN``  
================  ================  ================  ================  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right after verbatim word (with no space):

=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
        exact                 ``v_1``         :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``       ``verb_3_``       
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
                    9                   9.62                   5.57                   8.98  
                  -20                 -23.39                  -7.65                 -19.93  
                   10                  17.74                  -4.50                   9.96  
                    0                  -9.19                   4.13                  -0.26  
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript :math:`a_i`: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Files ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is
some text.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

**b)**
State some other problem.

**Hint 1.**
A hint can be given.

**Hint 2.**
Maybe even another hint?

.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote, as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. _Eq:my:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        



And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. _Eq:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: eq1
        
        a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        



.. _Eq:eq2:

.. math::
   :label: eq2
          
        b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

.. _Eq:multiline:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Testing split:

.. _Eq:split:envir:eq:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

We can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

Testing gather:

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


Testing alignat:

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2` again, and to the
alignat variant :ref:`(label:removed) <Eq:eq1a>`-:ref:`(label:removed) <Eq:eq2a>`, and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Testing eqnarray:

.. math::
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
        


More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in
between there we have :ref:`exer:some:formula`.

.. _demo:ex:2:

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval :math:`[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw :math:`N` such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, :math:`M`, that fall in the interval :math:`(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as :math:`M/N`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by


.. math::
        
        x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
        



.. math::
          
        y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        

where :math:`R` is the radius of the circle, :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and :math:`t` is a parameter in the unit interval :math:`[0,1]`.
For any :math:`t`, :math:`(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle:


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw :math:`N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.


**a)**
Let :math:`R` be normally distributed and :math:`(x_0,y_0)` uniformly distributed.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
:math:`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\bpycod
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\epycod

And some plain text verbatim:

\bccq
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\eccq

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out }]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title with math:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors2admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding. \par}
\end{block_colors2admon}





\begin{block_colors2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors2admon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\bpycod
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\epycod
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\bpycod
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\epycod
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\bpycod
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\epycod
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_colors2admon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts

And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.

Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[{\large Watch out }]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Test warning with title with math:


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors1admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-3.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset

\end{block_colors1admon}





\begin{block_colors1admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors1admon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors1admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Point1]

\begin{warning_colors1admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors1admon}

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_colors1admon}



\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_colors1admon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out }]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title with math:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors2admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding. \par}
\end{block_colors2admon}





\begin{block_colors2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors2admon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_colors2admon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]

Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}

    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):

                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{graybox2admon}




Test warning with title:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Watch out }.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Test warning with title with math:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding. \par}
\end{graybox2admon}







\begin{graybox2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{graybox2admon}




The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{graybox2admon}




% Test one word with a number



\begin{graybox2admon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{graybox2admon}




Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).



\begin{graybox2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{graybox2admon}




\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
\end{center}
\end{graybox2admon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\grayboxhrules{
\textbf{Concluding remarks, for the novice:} We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have

\subsection{Code}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{paragraphadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{paragraphadmon}[{\large Watch out }.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Test warning with title with math:


\begin{paragraphadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Block with title.]
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding. \par}
\end{paragraphadmon}





\begin{paragraphadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{paragraphadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{paragraphadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{paragraphadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{paragraphadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
\end{center}
\end{paragraphadmon}



\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_yellowboxadmon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts

And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_yellowboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_yellowboxadmon}[{\large Watch out }]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. \par}
\end{warning_yellowboxadmon}



Test warning with title with math:


\begin{warning_yellowboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations }]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view. \par}
\end{warning_yellowboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_yellowboxadmon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon

\begin{block_yellowboxadmon}[]

Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)

\end{warning_yellowboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\end{notice_yellowboxadmon}



\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_yellowboxadmon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out.</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #BDE5F8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out.</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out.</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

and the surrounding text.</p>
<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">automake_sphinx.py</span></tt> fixes the HTML file generated by Sphinx
so that all styles for admonitions have a colored background.</p>
<div class="section" id="code">

<div class="section" id="admonitions">
<h2>Admonitions<a class="headerlink" href="#admonitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us start with a plain warning environment.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>and a list</li>
<li>with items</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.</p>
</div>
<p>Test warning with title:</p>
<div class="admonition-watch-out admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Watch out</p>
<p class="last">And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.</p>
</div>
<p>Test warning with title with math:</p>
<div class="admonition-watch-out-for-math-nabla-cdot-boldsymbol-u-0-equations admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Watch out for <span class="math">\(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0\)</span> equations</p>
<p class="last">Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.</p>
</div>
<p>Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.</p>
<div class="admonition-block-with-title admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Block with title</p>
<p class="last">Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.</p>
</div>
<p>Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, we have not specified any title, and Doconce then
applies the generic title &#8220;Notice:&#8221;</p>
<div class="admonition-notice admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Notice</p>
<p class="last">Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.</p>
</div>
<p>The next admonition features a title &#8220;Note, eventually!&#8221;.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-eventually admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note, eventually</p>
<p>Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{r}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="last math">
\[\begin{split}\theta &amp;= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &amp;= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}\end{split}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition-point1 admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Point1</p>
<p class="last">Ah, we are soon close to the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-question admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Question</p>
<p class="last">So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-question admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Question</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>

</div>
<div class="admonition-tip admonition">

<p>It is of outmost important to</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>stay cool</li>
<li>read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>
<p>Because here the thing is to do</p>
<div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next is a warning without a title (&#8220;none&#8221; implies no title).
Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, we have not specified any title, and Doconce then
applies the generic title &#8220;Notice:&#8221;</p>
<div class="admonition-notice admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Notice</p>
<p class="last">And here comes some text with bad news.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="going-deeper-environments">
<h2>Going deeper environments<a class="headerlink" href="#going-deeper-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.</p>
<div class="admonition-going-deeper admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Going deeper</p>
<p>We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.</p>
<p>Let us start with some equations:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{Du}{dt} &amp;= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &amp;= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &amp;= \pmb{n}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this &#8220;Going deeper&#8221; environment targets.</p>

</div>
<p>And some more text that can help going into the next page.

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_warning.png" hspace="5" alt="warning"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Warning.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-large">And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.</div>

<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<div class="alert-text-large">Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr><th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Block with title.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-small">Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_notice.png" hspace="5" alt="notice"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Going deeper.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Watch out.</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>


<!-- admonition: block, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: block, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: question, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: question, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>


<!-- admonition: summary, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)*exp(<span style="color: #B452CD">1</span>-x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out.</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #008b45; text-decoration: underline">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">Dudt</span>(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half = <span style="color: #B452CD">0.5</span>
x = <span style="color: #B452CD">2</span>*n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0

\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}

#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Testing admons

By '''hpl'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

== Introduction ==
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


==== Code ====

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>

And some plain text verbatim:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Admonitions ====

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Warning.''' And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.


<ul>
  <li> and a list
  <li> with items
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
}}



Test warning with title:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Watch out.''' And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
}}



Test warning with title with math:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Watch out for <math>\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0</math> equations.''' Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
}}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

''Block with title''\n
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
''without any icon'' and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.




Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: illegal-size;
| text = '''Note, eventually!''' Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <math>\theta</math> and <math>\bm{r}</math>:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
</math>
}}



<!-- Test one word with a number -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Point1.''' Ah, we are soon close to the end.
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' 
<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</ol>
}}




{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Tip.''' It is of outmost important to


<ol>
<li> stay cool
<li> read hints and tips carefully
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' And here comes some text with bad news.
}}



==== Going deeper environments ====

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Going deeper.''' We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
</syntaxhighlight>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
</syntaxhighlight>
And then we add a figure too.

==== The end ====

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

!bpop highlight-red
Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.
And a line more
!epop

[hpl: Here are some notes that can go to notes typesetting
in the slide environment.]

!bnotes
One can also have ordinary notes.
Over multiple lines.
!enotes

!split
===== Scientific writing needs to address many new media =====

!bpop

 * Old days (1985-2005): mostly black-and-white documents aimed at printing
 * Now: also color PDF, web pages, wikis - for paper, PC, iPad, ...
 * LaTeX writing may be very different from writing in other formats
 * Main problem:
    * LaTeX provide all sorts of fancy packages, but
    * PDF in browsers has limited capabilities (design, navigation)
      compared to native HTML formats
 * Conclusion: We need more than LaTeX

!epop

!split
===== Some math and computer code =====

!bt
\[ f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y \]
!et
Python implementation:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np

def f(x, y, t):
    return np.exp(-x*t)*np.sin(np.pi*y)

class Fancy:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __call__(self, x, y, t):
        return f(x, y, t)

f2 = Fancy()
!ec

!split
===== Admon blocks =====

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

!bnotice Key PDE:
This box has title and math in normal 90 percent font:
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
!et
!enotice

!bpop
!bnotice None
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
!enotice
!epop

!bwarning (small)
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

 <p><li class="fragment"> Now: also color PDF, web pages, wikis - for paper, PC, iPad, ...</li>

 <p><li class="fragment"> Main problem:</li>

<ul>
    <p><li class="fragment"> LaTeX provide all sorts of fancy packages, but</li>
    <p><li class="fragment"> PDF in browsers has limited capabilities (design, navigation)

<p class="fragment">

<div class="fragment alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
</div>


</p>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-small"><b>Warning.</b>
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

# Insert links here to reports

!bslidecell 00
Old days (1985-2005): LaTeX for BW paper output, but now

   o BW books
   o Colorful PDF books (printed and screen)
   o Designed web pages
   o Wikis
   o Blog posts
   o Next new fancy format (iBook w/LaTeX?)

======= Fundamental question =======

When I write some scientific material,

 * a LaTeX document,
 * a blog post (HTML),
 * some web pages (HTML),
 * a Sphinx document,
 * some Markdown files,

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

!bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

 * LaTeX inline math: works with all (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki)
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX (can run separately), just raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; inline tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Page references: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but not on paper!)
!epop

!bpop
Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.

!split
======= Doconce: title, authors, date, toc =======

!bc
TITLE: Some Title
AUTHOR: name1 at institution1, with more info, and institution2
AUTHOR: name2 email:name2@web.com at institution
DATE: today

# A table of contents is optional:
TOC: on
!ec

!bnotice
Title and authors must have all information *on a single line*!
!enotice

!split
======= Doconce: abstract =======

!bc
__Abstract.__
Here goes the abstract...
!ec

Or:
!bc
__Summary.__
Here goes the summary...
!ec


!split
======= Doconce: section headings =======

Headings are surrounded by `=` signs:
!bc
========= This is an H1/chapter heading =========

======= This is an H2/section heading =======

===== This is an H3/subsection heading =====

=== This is an H4/paragraph heading ===

__This is a paragraph heading.__
!ec

Result:

========= This is an H1/chapter heading =========

======= This is an H2/section heading =======

===== This is an H3/subsection heading =====

=== This is an H4/paragraph heading ===

__This is a paragraph heading.__


!split
======= Doconce: markup and lists =======

!bc
 * Bullet list items start with `*`
   and may span several lines
 * *Emphasized words* are possible
 * _Boldface words_ are also possible
 * color{red}{colored words} too
 * `inline verbatim code` is featured
   o and sublists with enumerated items starting with `o`
   o items are just indented as you would do in email
!ec

This gets rendered as

 * `inline verbatim code` is featured
   o and sublists with enumerated items starting with `o`
   o items are just indented as you would do in email

!split
======= Doconce: labels, references, index items =======

!bc
# Insert index items in the source
idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).

# Make hyperlink
"some link text": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"

# Hyperlink with complete URL as link text
URL: "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
!ec

!split
======= Doconce: figures and movies =======

!bnotice
Figure with HTML and LaTeX info, and caption, *all on one line*:
!enotice

!bc
FIGURE: [figdir/myfig, width=300 frac=1.2] My caption. label{fig1}

# This figure will be 300 pixels wide in HTML and span 1.2 times
# the linewidth in LaTeX.
!ec

Movies are also supported:

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]
!ec
and rendered as

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

!split
======= Doconce: math =======

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.


An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags,
the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
which is rendered as

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
!et


!split
======= Doconce: displaying code =======

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags:

!bc
|bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec
!ec
This gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

!bnotice Language-dependent typesetting of code:
The `!bc` command can be followed by a specification of the computer
language: `pycod` for Python code snippet, `pypro` for complete Python
program, `fcod` for Fortran snippet, `fpro` for Fortran program, and so
forth (`c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `m` for Matlab).
!enotice


!split
======= Doconce: displaying interactive demo code =======
label{slide:pot}

With `!bc pyoptpro` or a file `*.pyopt`, the code applies the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com" for displaying
program flow and state of variables:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/dc_mod.pyopt




!split
======= Doconce: exercises =======

Doconce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:

!bc

files = flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py
keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

|bsubex
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.

|bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Compute the probability of getting heads.

|bans
A short answer: 0.5.
|eans

|bsol
A full solution to this subexercise can go here.

 * Key point 3 takes very much more text to explain because
   this point is really comprehensive, and although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/teacher1, width=100]

Key equation:

|bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]

<h2>Fundamental question  <a name="___sec5"></a></h2>

<p>
When I write some scientific material,

<p>

<ul>
 <p><li> a LaTeX document,</li>
 <p><li> a blog post (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> some web pages (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> a Sphinx document,</li>
 <p><li> some Markdown files,</li>
</ul>
<p>

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

<p>

<p class="fragment">

<span class="fragment highlight-red">

Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

<h2>Doconce: example on slide code with cells  <a name="___sec29"></a></h2>

<p>
One can introduce a table-like layout with MxN cells and
put slide elements in various cell. A cell with position
MN is surrounded by <code>!bslidecell MN</code> and <code>!eslidecell</code>
tags. Below is an example with a bullet list to the left and
a figure to the right (two cells, numbered 00 and 01).

\section{Fundamental question}

When I write some scientific material,

\begin{itemize}
 \item a {\LaTeX} document,

 \item a blog post (HTML),

 \item some web pages (HTML),

 \item a Sphinx document,

 \item some Markdown files,
\end{itemize}

\noindent
and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

% !bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

## Comments start with a # and are visible as comments in the
## output. Lines starting with ## are also comments, but not visible
## in the output.

!split

## Headings have 5 = for h3/subsection and 7 = for h1/section
======= Goal =======

The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with "Doconce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
# #if FORMAT in ("html", "pdflatex", "latex")
!bnotice Layout
This version
utilizes ${SLIDE_TYPE} slides with the theme ${SLIDE_THEME}.
!enotice
# #endif

## Demonstrate use of Mako variables set on the command line
## (see last sentence too). We use Preprocess (run before Mako)
## to leave out the Mako test on SLIDE_THEME and SLIDE_TYPE.
## In that way, we do not need to specify these variables on
## the command line when compiling for LaTeX or other formats
## (e.g. for handouts).

# #if FORMAT == "html"
!bnotice
Speaker notes show up by
% if SLIDE_TYPE == 'reveal':
pressing "s".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'deck':
pressing "n".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
pressing "Ctrl-P".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'html5slides':
pressing "p".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
using the "onstage.html": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/dzslides/shells/onstage.html" embedding page.
% endif
!enotice
# #endif

## Add speaker notes (can also use preprocess or mako for this)

!bnotes
The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u'=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.
!enotes

## New slide is indicated by !split at the beginning of a line:

======= Mathematical problem =======

## Use !bslidecell XY and !eslidecell as begin and end for
## defining a cell XY in a table layout of the slide.
## X=0,1,..., Y=0,1,... XY=00 is the upper left cell.
## Here we define cell 00 and 01 (bullet list to the left
## and figure to the right).

label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et

 * $t\in (0,T]$
 * $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters
 * $u(t)$ is the unknown function

======= Numerical solution method =======

## !bpop and !epop surround elements that are to pop up
## as we progress in the slide show.
## They will often not work if there is code inside.

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

!bpop
Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

# #if FORMAT == "html"

!split
## Next: embed YouTube video

===== Forward Euler explained =====

MOVIE: [http://youtu.be/PtJrPEIHNJw, width=640 height=480]

# #endif

!split
## Next: exemplify copying code directly from file (start
## with the line matching "def solver" and ending with
## "def verify_three", but not including this last line).

======= Implementation =======

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver@def verify_three

!split
===== The Crank-Nicolson method =====

## Figure filenames do not need extension - the right version is picked

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/CN, width=600]

!split
===== The artifacts can be explained by some theory =====

!bpop
Exact solution of the scheme:

!bt
\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
!et
!epop

!bpop
 * Stability: $|A| < 1$
 * No oscillations: $A>0$
 * Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)
 * $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)
 * $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
!epop

## The summary environment appears in a box in most formats
## (warning, notice, hint, question are other environments)
!bpop
!bsummary Concluding remarks:
Only the Backward Euler scheme is guaranteed to always give
qualitatively correct results.

<h2>Goal  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" target="_self">Doconce</a>
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Layout.</b>
This version
utilizes reveal slides with the theme beigesmall.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Notice.</b>
Speaker notes show up by
pressing "s".
</div>


<p>
<aside class="notes">
<!-- click "s" to activate -->

The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation \( u'=-au \) with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.

    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition

OK, this is fixed:


```Python
def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c

```

### Updated task list

   - [x] Offer an `f(x)` function

   - [ ] Extension to cubic functions

   - [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function

#### Remaining functionality

TITLE: My Test of Class Doconce
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen; Simula Research Laboratory; Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
DATE: Jan 32, 2100



======= First Section =======


Here is some
text for section 1.

This is a *first* example of using the _DocWriter
module_ for writing documents from *Python* scripts.
It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as `fixed width fonts`
in plain text.

===== First Subsection =====

Some text for the subsection.

__Test of a Paragraph.__ 
Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:
o item1
o item2

    o subitem1
    o subitem2

o item3

    o subitem3
    o subitem4
...with some trailing text.
=== First Subsubsection with an Itemize List ===


* item1
* item2

    * subitem1
    * subitem2

* item3

    * subitem3
    * subitem4
Here is some Python code:
!bc

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

!ec

======= Second Section =======

Here is a description list:
- keyword1:  item1
- keyword2:  item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after

    - key3:  subitem1
    - key4:  subitem2

- key5:  item3

    - key6:  subitem3
    - key7:  subitem4


And here is a table:

   |---------------------------------------|
   | a                 | b                 |
   | c                 | d                 |
   | e                 | and a longer text |

<h1>First Section</h1>

Here is some
text for section 1.

This is a <em>first</em> example of using the <b>DocWriter
module</b> for writing documents from <em>Python</em> scripts.
It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as <tt>fixed width fonts</tt>
in plain text.

<h3>First Subsection</h3>
Some text for the subsection.

<p><!-- paragraph with heading -->
<b>Test of a Paragraph.</b>

Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="quickref.do.txt">quickref.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce quickref, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html quickref.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="quickref.html">quickref.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex quickref.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="quickref.tex">quickref.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="quickref.pdf">quickref.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    quickref.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx quickref.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="quickref.rst">quickref.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="quickref.xml">XML</a>, <a href="quickref.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="quickref.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="quickref.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="quickref.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="quickref.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="quickref.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.mwiki">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.md">a Pandoc</a>,
<a href="quickref.st">Structured Text</a>,
<a href="quickref.epytext">Epytext</a>,
and maybe the most important format of all:
<a href="quickref.txt">plain untagged ASCII text</a>.

TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today
TOC: on

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

__Mission.__ Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

===== Supported Formats =====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


===== Emacs syntax support =====

The file ".doconce-mode.el":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el"
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Emacs key      | Action                                |
|----l-------------------------l-------------------------|

|--------------------------------------------------------|

===== Title, Authors, and Date =====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
!ec
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
!bc
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
!ec
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


===== Section Types =====
label{quick:sections}

|----------------c--------|------------------c---------------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                                |
|----------------l--------|------------------l---------------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         |
| abstract                | `__Abstract.__` Running text...              |
| appendix                | `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| appendix                | `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
| exercise                | `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| exercise                | `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

===== Inline Formatting =====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text
!bc
`color{red}{two red words}`
!ec
becomes color{red}{two red words}.

===== Lists =====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
!bc
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
!ec
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line


===== Comment lines =====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


===== Inline comments =====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
!bc
[name: running text]
!ec
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
!ec
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
!bc sys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

===== Verbatim/Computer Code =====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
!bc
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
!ec
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

!bc cod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
!ec

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
!bc
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
!ec
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
!bc
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
!ec
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
## Note: |bt and |et (and |bc and |ec below) are used to illustrate
## tex and code blocks in inside verbatim blocks and are replaced
## by !bt, !et, !bc, and !ec after all other formatting is finished.

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
Here is a single equation:

!bc
|bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
|et
!ec
which results in

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

!bnotice
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
!enotice

__LaTeX Newcommands.__
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


===== Hyperlinks =====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

!bc
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
!ec

===== Figures and Movies =====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
!bc
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

!ec
Note three important syntax details:

  o A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
  o no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,
  o all of the command must appear on a single line,
  o there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
!bc sys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
!ec
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

!ec
The latter results in

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.


===== Tables =====

The table in Section ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
!bc
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
!ec

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

===== Labels and References =====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
!bc
label{name}
!ec
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
!bc
ref{name}
!ec
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


===== Citations and Bibliography =====

Single citations are written as
!bc
cite{name}
!ec
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
!bc
cite{name1,name2,name3}
!ec

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
"Publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

===== Generalized Citations =====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
!bc
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
!ec
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`ref{label}` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

===== Index of Keywords =====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
!bc
index{name}
!ec
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

===== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` =====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

@@@CODE doconce_program.sh

===== Exercises =====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
!bc
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

|bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
|ehint

|bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
|ehint
!ec
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

!bc
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
!ec
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

|bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

|bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
|eans

|bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
|ehint

|bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

|bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
|ehint

|bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
|esol
|esubex

|bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
|eremarks

|bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
|esol

!ec
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


===== Environments =====

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide


===== Preprocessing =====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

!bc
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
!ec

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "example document": "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

<b>WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!</b>

<p>
<b>Mission.</b>
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code <em>once, in one place</em> and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

<h3>Supported Formats  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)</li>
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)</li>
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)</li>
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)</li>
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)</li>
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)</li>
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)</li>
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)</li>
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)</li>
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

<h3>Emacs syntax support  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

The file <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el" target="_self">.doconce-mode.el</a>
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

<p>
Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>             Emacs key              </b></td> <td align="center"><b>               Action               </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f                              </td> <td align="left">   figure                                </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c v                              </td> <td align="left">   movie/video                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h1                             </td> <td align="left">   heading level 1 (section/h1)          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h2                             </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h2)       </td> </tr>

</table>

<h3>Title, Authors, and Date  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory &amp; Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 &amp; institution2
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

<p>
The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

<p>
The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.

<h3>Section Types <a name="quick:sections"></a></h3>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                            Section type                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                               Syntax                              </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection                                                           </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection                                                        </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph                                                            </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Appendix: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Appendix: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Exercise: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Exercise: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

<p>
The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

<h3>Inline Formatting  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
<em>emphasized words</em>. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes <b>boldface</b>. Colored words
are also possible: the text
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>`color{red}{two red words}`
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

<h3>Lists  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
There are three types of lists: <em>bullet lists</em>, where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, <em>enumeration lists</em>, where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and <em>description</em> lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The code above follows.

<p>
Here is a bullet list:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> item1</li>
 <li> item2</li>

<ul>
  <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
  <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ul>

 <li> item3</li>
</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines</li>

<ol>
 <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
 <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ol>

<li> item3</li>
</ol>

And finally a description list:

<p>

<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

<h3>Comment lines  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

<p>
Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

<p>
Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

<p>
When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.

<h3>Inline comments  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>

<p>
Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>[name: running text]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. Here goes an example.

<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->

The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the <code>-DTOTONOTES</code> option to <code>ptex2tex</code> or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the <code>todonotes</code> package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

<p>
Running
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

<p>
All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h3>Verbatim/Computer Code  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

<p>
Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

<p>
The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<p>
Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre><code>from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code> @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the <em>regular
expression</em> <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including the line
matching the <em>regular expression</em> <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

<p>
The copied line from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active
for <code>latex</code> and <code>sphinx</code> outout.

<p>
Important warnings:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.</li>
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

<p>
Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
\( Ax=b \). To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

<p>
Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &amp;= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
This LaTeX code gets rendered as

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

Here is a single equation:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
which results in

<p>
$$ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.$$


<p>
Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>,
    <code>equation</code>, <code>equation*</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>align*</code>.</li>
  <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.</li>
</ul>

(Doconce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Notice.</b>
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code>, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
</div>


<p>
<b>LaTeX Newcommands.</b>
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.

<h3>Hyperlinks  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>

<p>
Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is some &quot;some link text&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/address&quot;
(as in &quot;search google&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;)
or just the raw address: URL: &quot;http://google.com&quot;.

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
&quot;`myfile.py`&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py&quot;.

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
&quot;`hpl@simula.no`&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;
or just &quot;send mail&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h3>Figures and Movies  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Note three important syntax details:

<p>

<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,</li>
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,</li>
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,</li>
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.</li>
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

<p>
The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

<p>
Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

<p>
Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

<p>
YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The latter results in

<p>

<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>

<h3>Tables  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>

<p>
The table in the section <a href="#quick:sections">Section Types</a> was written with this
syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |

<p>
Note that

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).</li>
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.</li>
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.</li>
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

<h3>Labels and References  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>

<p>
The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>label{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, say <code>a:b:c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<code>c</code> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

<p>
A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>ref{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

<p>
Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

<h3>Citations and Bibliography  <a name="___sec14"></a></h3>

<p>
Single citations are written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name1,name2,name3}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" target="_self">Publish</a> format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

<h3>Generalized Citations  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>

<p>
There is a <em>generalized referencing</em> feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;testdoc.html#___sec2&quot; in the document
&quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;: &quot;testdoc.html&quot; cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
<code>ref{label}</code> references in <code>internal</code> are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

<h3>Index of Keywords  <a name="___sec16"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>index{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

<h3>Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code>  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>

<p>
The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  shpro-->

<h3>Exercises  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports <em>Exercise</em>, <em>Problem</em>, <em>Project</em>, and <em>Example</em>.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain <em>elements</em>:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)</li>
  <li> a label (optional)</li>
  <li> a solution file (optional)</li>
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)</li>
  <li> main exercise text (required)</li>
  <li> a short answer (optional)</li>
  <li> a full solution (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more hints (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)</li>
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
&quot;Wolframalpha&quot;: &quot;http://wolframalpha.com&quot; can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

<p>
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

<h3>Environments  <a name="___sec19"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)</li>
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax</li>
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text</li>
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color</li>
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations</li>
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preprocessing  <a name="___sec20"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

<p>
The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># #include &quot;myotherdoc.do.txt&quot;

# #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          &amp; 1.4186       &amp; -5.01        \\ 
2.0          &amp; 1.376512     &amp; 11.919       \\ 
4.0          &amp; 1.1E+1       &amp; 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" target="_self">example document</a> contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

\textbf{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

\paragraph{Mission.}
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code \emph{once, in one place} and include it in traditional {\LaTeX}
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's \code{blogger.com}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

\subsection{Supported Formats}

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\LaTeX} (format \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex})

 \item HTML (format \code{html})

 \item reStructuredText (format \code{rst})

 \item plain (untagged) ASCII (format \code{plain})

 \item Sphinx (format \code{sphinx})

 \item IPython notebook (format \code{ipynb})

 \item MediaWiki (format \code{mwiki})

 \item (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format \code{pandoc})

 \item Googlecode wiki (format \code{gwiki})

 \item Creoloe wiki (format \code{cwiki})

 \item Epydoc (format \code{epydoc})

 \item StructuredText (format \code{st})
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex}, \code{sphinx}, and \code{html}; and to a slightly
less extent \code{mwiki} and \code{pandoc}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


\subsection{Emacs syntax support}

The file \href{{https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el}}{.doconce-mode.el}
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
\code{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")} to the \code{.emacs} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Emacs key } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Action } \\
\hline
Ctrl+c f                           & figure                             \\
Ctrl+c v                           & movie/video                        \\
Ctrl+c h1                          & heading level 1 (section/h1)       \\
Ctrl+c h2                          & heading level 2 (subsection/h2)    \\
Ctrl+c h3                          & heading level 2 (subsection/h3)    \\
Ctrl+c hp                          & heading for paragraph              \\

Ctrl+c table4                      & table with 4 columns               \\
Ctrl+c exer                        & exercise outline                   \\
Ctrl+c slide                       & slide outline                      \\
Ctrl+c help                        & print this table                   \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\subsection{Title, Authors, and Date}

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
\bccq
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
\eccq
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
\bccq
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
\eccq
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the \code{&} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword \code{and} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from \code{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., \code{Jan 32, 2100}.

The table of contents is removed by writing \code{TOC: off}.


\subsection{Section Types}
\label{quick:sections}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Section type } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Syntax } \\
\hline
chapter                                               & \code{========= Heading ========} (9 \code{=})        \\
section                                               & \code{======= Heading =======}    (7 \code{=})        \\
subsection                                            & \code{===== Heading =====}        (5 \code{=})        \\
subsubsection                                         & \code{=== Heading ===}            (3 \code{=})        \\
paragraph                                             & \code{__Heading.__}               (2 \code{_})        \\
abstract                                              & \code{__Abstract.__} Running text...                  \\
appendix                                              & \code{======= Appendix: heading =======} (7 \code{=}) \\
appendix                                              & \code{===== Appendix: heading =====} (5 \code{=})     \\
exercise                                              & \code{======= Exercise: heading =======} (7 \code{=}) \\
exercise                                              & \code{===== Exercise: heading =====} (5 \code{=})     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with \code{__Abstract.__} or
\code{__Summary.__} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more \code{=} signs of the next heading.

The \code{Exercise:} keyword kan be substituted by \code{Problem:} or \code{Project:}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

\subsection{Inline Formatting}

Words surrounded by \code{*} are emphasized: \code{*emphasized words*} becomes
\emph{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: \code{_boldface_} becomes \textbf{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text
\bccq
`color{red}{two red words}`
\eccq
becomes \textcolor{red}{two red words}.

\subsection{Lists}

There are three types of lists: \emph{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with \code{*}, \emph{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with \code{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and \emph{description} lists, where each item starts with \code{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
\bccq
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
\eccq
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

\begin{itemize}
 \item item1

 \item item2
\begin{itemize}

  \item subitem1 of item2

  \item subitem2 of item2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
 \item item3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
\begin{enumerate}

 \item subitem1 of item2

 \item subitem2 of item2

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\item item3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
And finally a description list:

\begin{description}
 \item[keyword1:] 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 \item[keyword2:] 
   followed by text on the next line

 \item[keyword3:] 
   and its description may fit on one line
\end{description}

\noindent
\subsection{Comment lines}

Lines starting with \code{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before {\LaTeX} math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats \code{rst} and
\code{sphinx} are desired.

Comment lines starting with \code{##} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
\code{# #ifdef EXTRA} and \code{# #endif} around the text. The command line
option \code{-DEXTRA} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


\subsection{Inline comments}

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
\bccq
[name: running text]
\eccq
where \code{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and \code{running text} is the comment. Here goes an example.
\shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines. }{ There must be a }
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with {\LaTeX}
output and the \code{-DTOTONOTES} option to \code{ptex2tex} or \code{doconce ptex2tex},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the \code{todonotes} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
\bsys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
\esys
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
\bsys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
\esys

\subsection{Verbatim/Computer Code}

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
\bccq
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
\eccq
resulting in Some sentence with \code{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between \code{!bc xxx} and \code{!ec} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification \code{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for \code{xxx} are
nothing, \code{cod} for a code snippet, \code{pro} for a complete program,
\code{sys} for a terminal session, \code{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
\code{Xpro} or \code{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming \code{X}, where \code{X} may be \code{py} for Python,
\code{cy} for Cython, \code{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
\code{f} for Fortran, \code{c} for C, \code{cpp} for C++, \code{m} for MATLAB,
\code{pl} for Perl. For output in \code{latex} one can let \code{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the \code{ptex2tex} configuration file
(\code{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For \code{sphinx} output one can insert a comment
\bccq
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\eccq
that maps environments (\code{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what \code{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The \code{xxx} specifier has only effect for \code{latex} and
\code{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

\bcod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
\ecod

% When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
% ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
\bccq
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
\eccq
The \code{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file \code{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the \emph{regular
expression} \code{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the \emph{regular expression} \code{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside \code{!bc shpro}
and \code{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become \code{!bc shcod} and \code{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension \code{.X}, the environment
becomes \code{!bc Xpro} or \code{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (\code{Xcod} and \code{Xpro}) are only active
for \code{latex} and \code{sphinx} outout.

Important warnings:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 \item Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard {\LaTeX} syntax. The output formats \code{html}, \code{sphinx}, \code{latex},
pdflatex`, \code{pandoc}, and \code{mwiki} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw {\LaTeX} code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
{\LaTeX} way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than \code{sphinx},
\code{latex}, and \code{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
\bccq
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
\eccq
That is, the {\LaTeX} expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of {\LaTeX} mathematics are written within
\code{!bt}
and
\code{!et} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
\eccq

This {\LaTeX} code gets rendered as

\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
Here is a single equation:

\bccq
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
\eccq
which results in

\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any {\LaTeX} syntax is accepted, but if output in the \code{sphinx}, \code{pandoc},
\code{mwiki}, \code{html}, or \code{ipynb} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use only the equation environments \code{\[}, \code{\]},
    \code{equation}, \code{equation*}, \code{align}, and \code{align*}.

  \item MediaWiki (\code{mwiki}) does not support references to equations.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
(Doconce performs extensions to \code{sphinx} and other formats such that
labels in \code{align} environments work well.)


\begin{graybox1admon}[Notice.]
{\LaTeX} supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as \code{sphinx}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard {\LaTeX} and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically \code{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
include special code for \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced {\LaTeX} features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
\end{graybox1admon}



\paragraph{LaTeX Newcommands.}
The author can define \code{newcommand} statements in files with names
\code{newcommands*.tex}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other {\LaTeX} constructions are only understood by {\LaTeX} itself).
The convention is that \code{newcommands_keep.tex}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in \code{newcommands_replace.tex} will be replaced by their full
{\LaTeX} code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without {\LaTeX} support. For \code{html}, \code{sphinx}, \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex},
\code{mwiki}, \code{ipynb}, and \code{pandoc}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

\bccq
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
\eccq

\subsection{Figures and Movies}

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
\bccq
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

\eccq
Note three important syntax details:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 \item no comments between \code{width}, \code{height}, and \code{frac} and no spaces
    around the \code{=} characters,

 \item all of the command must appear on a single line,

 \item there must be a blank line after the command.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or {\LaTeX} formats). The \code{width}
and \code{height} parameters affect HTML formats (\code{html}, \code{rst}, \code{sphinx}),
while \code{frac} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
\bsys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
\esys
This command applies \code{montage} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in \code{html} and \code{sphinx} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

\bccq
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

\eccq
The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. \href{{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}{\nolinkurl{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}


\subsection{Tables}

The table in Section~\ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
\bccq
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
\eccq

Note that

\begin{itemize}
 \item Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 \item If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in {\LaTeX}.

 \item Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The command-line option \code{--tables2csv} (to \code{doconce format})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file \code{table_X.csv},
where \code{X} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

\subsection{Labels and References}

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from {\LaTeX} with a very similar syntax. As in {\LaTeX}, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
\bccq
label{name}
\eccq
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose \code{name}
as some hierarchical name, say \code{a:b:c}, where \code{a} and \code{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
\code{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label \code{name} is written as
\bccq
ref{name}
\eccq
again with no backslash before \code{ref}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


\subsection{Citations and Bibliography}

Single citations are written as
\bccq
cite{name}
\eccq
where \code{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, {\LaTeX} writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have \code{name} on the form
\code{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, \code{Author_YYYY}, or \code{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
\code{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
\bccq
cite{name1,name2,name3}
\eccq

The bibliography is specified by a line \code{BIBFILE: papers.pub},
where \code{papers.pub} is a publication database in the
\href{{https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish}}{Publish} format.
\textsc{Bib}\negthinspace{\TeX} \code{.bib} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than {\LaTeX}).

\subsection{Generalized Citations}

There is a \emph{generalized referencing} feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with \code{ref} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
\bccq
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
\eccq
The output from a generalized reference is the text \code{internal} if all
\code{ref{label}} references in \code{internal} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
\code{latex} or \code{pdflatex} one assumes that the references in \code{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line \code{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is \code{internal cite} and the
{\LaTeX} package \code{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
\code{external} text will be the output.

\subsection{Index of Keywords}

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
\bccq
index{name}
\eccq
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the \code{latex},
\code{pdflatex}, \code{rst}, and \code{sphinx} formats.

\subsection{Capabilities of The Program \protect\code{doconce} }

The \code{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a \code{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

\bshpro

\eshpro

\subsection{Exercises}

Doconce supports \emph{Exercise}, \emph{Problem}, \emph{Project}, and \emph{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain \emph{elements}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  \item a label (optional)

  \item a solution file (optional)

  \item name of file with a student solution (optional)

  \item main exercise text (required)

  \item a short answer (optional)

  \item a full solution (optional)

  \item one or more hints (optional)

  \item one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
\bccq
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
\eccq
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

\bccq
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\eccq
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

\bccq
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

\eccq
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments \code{--without_answers} and \code{--without_solutions}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


\subsection{Environments}

Doconce environments start with \code{!benvirname} and end with \code{!eenvirname},
where \code{envirname} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \code{c}: computer code (or verbatim text)

 \item \code{t}: math blocks with {\LaTeX} syntax

 \item \code{subex}: sub-exercise

 \item \code{ans}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \code{sol}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \code{quote}: indented text

 \item \code{notice}, \code{summary}, \code{warning}, \code{question}, \code{hint}: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 \item \code{pop}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 \item \code{slidecell}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Preprocessing}

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either \code{preprocess} and/or
\code{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The \code{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command \code{doconce format} first runs \code{preprocess} and then \code{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing \code{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

\bccq
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
\eccq

With the \code{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/}}{example document} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize \code{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the \code{doc/src/make.sh} script).

Doconce Quick Reference
-----------------------

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :depth: 2



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`_
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  
            Emacs key                             Action

==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.

exercise                                         ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
===============================================  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. Here goes an example.
(**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.)
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the ``-DTOTONOTES`` option to ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the ``todonotes`` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex`` and ``sphinx`` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
   Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
   PDF document.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        




Tables
------

The table in the section `Section Types`_ was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`_ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
``label`_` references in ``internal`` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

Doconce Quick Reference
-----------------------

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`_
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  
            Emacs key                             Action                
==================================  ==================================

Ctrl+c help                         print this table                    
==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

.. code-block:: text


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

.. code-block:: text


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.


.. _quick:sections:

Section Types
-------------

===============================================  ===============================================  
                  Section type                                        Syntax                      
===============================================  ===============================================  
chapter                                          ``========= Heading ========`` (9 ``=``)         
section                                          ``======= Heading =======``    (7 ``=``)         
subsection                                       ``===== Heading =====``        (5 ``=``)         
subsubsection                                    ``=== Heading ===``            (3 ``=``)         
paragraph                                        ``__Heading.__``               (2 ``_``)         
abstract                                         ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...                
appendix                                         ``======= Appendix: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
appendix                                         ``===== Appendix: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
exercise                                         ``======= Exercise: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
exercise                                         ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
===============================================  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text

.. code-block:: text


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

.. code-block:: text


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

.. code-block:: text


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. Here goes an example.
(**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.)
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the ``-DTOTONOTES`` option to ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the ``todonotes`` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

.. code-block:: console

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by

.. code-block:: console

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

.. code-block:: text


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment

.. code-block:: text


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file:

.. code-block:: text


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex`` and ``sphinx`` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
:math:`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

.. code-block:: text


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as


.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        

Here is a single equation:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in


.. math::
         \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
   Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
   PDF document.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:


.. code-block:: text


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

.. code-block:: text


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

.. code-block:: console

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is


.. code-block:: text


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        




Tables
------

The table in the section :ref:`quick:sections` was written with this
syntax:

.. code-block:: text


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

.. code-block:: text


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as

.. code-block:: text


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as

.. code-block:: text


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

.. code-block:: text


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`_ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

.. code-block:: text


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
`:ref:`label`` references in ``internal`` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

.. code-block:: text


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:


.. code-block:: bash

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

.. code-block:: text


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads


.. code-block:: text


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:


.. code-block:: text


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


.. code-block:: text


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

************** File: quickref.gwiki *****************
#summary Doconce Quick Reference

By *Hans Petter Langtangen*
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<wiki: toc max_depth="2" />



*WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!*

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 ||              *Emacs key*                ||                *Action*                 ||
 ||  Ctrl+c f                               ||  figure                                 ||
 ||  Ctrl+c v                               ||  movie/video                            ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h1                              ||  heading level 1 (section/h1)           ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h2                              ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)        ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h3                              ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)        ||
 ||  Ctrl+c hp                              ||  heading for paragraph                  ||
 ||  Ctrl+c me                              ||  math environment: !bt equation !et     ||
 ||  Ctrl+c ma                              ||  math environment: !bt align !et        ||
 ||  Ctrl+c ce                              ||  code environment: !bc !ec              ||
 ||  Ctrl+c cf                              ||  code from file: @@@CODE                ||

 ||  Ctrl+c table3                          ||  table with 3 columns                   ||
 ||  Ctrl+c table4                          ||  table with 4 columns                   ||
 ||  Ctrl+c exer                            ||  exercise outline                       ||
 ||  Ctrl+c slide                           ||  slide outline                          ||
 ||  Ctrl+c help                            ||  print this table                       ||


==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


==== Section Types ====

 ||                  *Section type*                  ||                     *Syntax*                     ||
 ||  chapter                                         ||  `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)            ||
 ||  section                                         ||  `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsection                                      ||  `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsubsection                                   ||  `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)            ||
 ||  paragraph                                       ||  `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)            ||
 ||  abstract                                        ||  `__Abstract.__` Running text...                 ||
 ||  appendix                                        ||  `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  appendix                                        ||  `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||
 ||  exercise                                        ||  `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  exercise                                        ||  `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes *boldface*. Colored words
are also possible: the text
{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 # subitem1 of item2
 # subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
}}}
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces    around the `=` characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized Citations ====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`label` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` ====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

}}}

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

************** File: quickref.mwiki *****************
#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Doconce Quick Reference

By '''Hans Petter Langtangen'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

__TOC__



'''WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!'''

''Mission.''
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code ''once, in one place'' and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>             Emacs key              </b></td> <td align="center"><b>               Action               </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f                              </td> <td align="left">   figure                                </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c v                              </td> <td align="left">   movie/video                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h1                             </td> <td align="left">   heading level 1 (section/h1)          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h2                             </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h2)       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h3                             </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h3)       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c hp                             </td> <td align="left">   heading for paragraph                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c me                             </td> <td align="left">   math environment: !bt equation !et    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c ma                             </td> <td align="left">   math environment: !bt align !et       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c ce                             </td> <td align="left">   code environment: !bc !ec             </td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c table4                         </td> <td align="left">   table with 4 columns                  </td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c slide                          </td> <td align="left">   slide outline                         </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c help                           </td> <td align="left">   print this table                      </td> </tr>
</table>
==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</syntaxhighlight>
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
</syntaxhighlight>
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.


==== Section Types ====

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                            Section type                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                               Syntax                              </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection                                                           </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection                                                        </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph                                                            </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Appendix: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Appendix: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Exercise: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Exercise: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
</table>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
''emphasized words''. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes '''boldface'''. Colored words
are also possible: the text
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
`color{red}{two red words}`
</syntaxhighlight>
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: ''bullet lists'', where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, ''enumeration lists'', where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and ''description'' lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</syntaxhighlight>
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


<ul>
 <li> item1
 <li> item2

<ul>
  <li><li> subitem1 of item2
  <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ul>

 <li> item3
</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

<ol>
 <li><li> subitem1 of item2
 <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ol>

<li> item3
</ol>

And finally a description list:


<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[name: running text]
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the <code>-DTOTONOTES</code> option to <code>ptex2tex</code> or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the <code>todonotes</code> package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</syntaxhighlight>
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</syntaxhighlight>
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</syntaxhighlight>
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
</syntaxhighlight>
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the ''regular
expression'' <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including the line
matching the ''regular expression'' <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active
for <code>latex</code> and <code>sphinx</code> outout.

Important warnings:


<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
</ul>

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
<math>Ax=b</math>. To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</syntaxhighlight>
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</syntaxhighlight>

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
</math>
Here is a single equation:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</syntaxhighlight>
which results in

:<math>
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
</math>

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>,
    <code>equation</code>, <code>equation*</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>align*</code>.
  <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.
</ul>

(Doconce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Notice.''' LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code>, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
}}



''LaTeX Newcommands.''
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</syntaxhighlight>
Note three important syntax details:


<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</syntaxhighlight>
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</syntaxhighlight>
The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
</syntaxhighlight>

Note that


<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
label{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, say <code>a:b:c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<code>c</code> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name1,name2,name3}
</syntaxhighlight>

The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized Citations ====

There is a ''generalized referencing'' feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
</syntaxhighlight>
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
<code>label</code> references in <code>internal</code> are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
index{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code> ====

The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports ''Exercise'', ''Problem'', ''Project'', and ''Example''.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain ''elements'':


<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  <li> a label (optional)
  <li> a solution file (optional)
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)
  <li> main exercise text (required)
  <li> a short answer (optional)
  <li> a full solution (optional)
  <li> one or more hints (optional)
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</syntaxhighlight>
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</syntaxhighlight>
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</syntaxhighlight>
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

Doconce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
</ul>

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</syntaxhighlight>

With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

#summary Doconce Quick Reference
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By **Hans Petter Langtangen**
=== Jan 32, 2100 ===

<<TableOfContents>>



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

//Mission.// Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code //once, in one place// and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's {{{blogger.com}}}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

== Supported Formats ==

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}})
 * HTML (format {{{html}}})
 * reStructuredText (format {{{rst}}})
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format {{{plain}}})
 * Sphinx (format {{{sphinx}}})
 * IPython notebook (format {{{ipynb}}})
 * MediaWiki (format {{{mwiki}}})
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format {{{pandoc}}})
 * Googlecode wiki (format {{{gwiki}}})
 * Creoloe wiki (format {{{cwiki}}})
 * Epydoc (format {{{epydoc}}})
 * StructuredText (format {{{st}}})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, and {{{html}}}; and to a slightly
less extent {{{mwiki}}} and {{{pandoc}}}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


== Emacs syntax support ==

The file [[https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el|.doconce-mode.el]]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
{{{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")}}} to the {{{.emacs}}} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 | =Emacs key                              | =Action                                 |
 |  Ctrl+c f                               |  figure                                 |
 |  Ctrl+c v                               |  movie/video                            |
 |  Ctrl+c h1                              |  heading level 1 (section/h1)           |
 |  Ctrl+c h2                              |  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)        |
 |  Ctrl+c h3                              |  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)        |
 |  Ctrl+c hp                              |  heading for paragraph                  |

 |  Ctrl+c cf                              |  code from file: @@@CODE                |

 |  Ctrl+c table3                          |  table with 3 columns                   |
 |  Ctrl+c table4                          |  table with 4 columns                   |
 |  Ctrl+c exer                            |  exercise outline                       |
 |  Ctrl+c slide                           |  slide outline                          |
 |  Ctrl+c help                            |  print this table                       |


== Title, Authors, and Date ==

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the {{{&}}} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword {{{and}}} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from {{{today}}} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., {{{Jan 32, 2100}}}.

The table of contents is removed by writing {{{TOC: off}}}.


== Section Types ==



 | =Section type                                            | =Syntax                                                  |
 |  chapter                                                 |  {{{========= Heading ========}}} (9 {{{=}}})            |
 |  section                                                 |  {{{======= Heading =======}}}    (7 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsection                                              |  {{{===== Heading =====}}}        (5 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsubsection                                           |  {{{=== Heading ===}}}            (3 {{{=}}})            |
 |  paragraph                                               |  {{{__Heading.__}}}               (2 {{{_}}})            |
 |  abstract                                                |  {{{__Abstract.__}}} Running text...                     |
 |  appendix                                                |  {{{======= Appendix: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  appendix                                                |  {{{===== Appendix: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |
 |  exercise                                                |  {{{======= Exercise: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  exercise                                                |  {{{===== Exercise: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with {{{__Abstract.__}}} or
{{{__Summary.__}}} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more {{{=}}} signs of the next heading.

The {{{Exercise:}}} keyword kan be substituted by {{{Problem:}}} or {{{Project:}}}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

== Inline Formatting ==

Words surrounded by {{{*}}} are emphasized: {{{*emphasized words*}}} becomes
//emphasized words//. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: {{{_boldface_}}} becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text
{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

== Lists ==

There are three types of lists: //bullet lists//, where each item starts
with {{{*}}}, //enumeration lists//, where each item starts with {{{o}}} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and //description// lists, where each item starts with {{{-}}} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  ** subitem1 of item2
  //* subitem2 of item2


 // item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 ## subitem1 of item2
 ## subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

== Comment lines ==

Lines starting with {{{#}}} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats {{{rst}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} are desired.

Comment lines starting with {{{##}}} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
{{{# #ifdef EXTRA}}} and {{{# #endif}}} around the text. The command line
option {{{-DEXTRA}}} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


== Inline comments ==

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where {{{name}}} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and {{{running text}}} is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the {{{-DTOTONOTES}}} option to {{{ptex2tex}}} or {{{doconce ptex2tex}}},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the {{{todonotes}}} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

== Verbatim/Computer Code ==

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with {{{words in verbatim style}}}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between {{{!bc xxx}}} and {{{!ec}}} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification {{{xxx}}} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for {{{xxx}}} are
nothing, {{{cod}}} for a code snippet, {{{pro}}} for a complete program,
{{{sys}}} for a terminal session, {{{dat}}} for a data file (or output from a
program),
{{{Xpro}}} or {{{Xcod}}} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming {{{X}}}, where {{{X}}} may be {{{py}}} for Python,
{{{cy}}} for Cython, {{{sh}}} for Bash or other Unix shells,
{{{f}}} for Fortran, {{{c}}} for C, {{{cpp}}} for C++, {{{m}}} for MATLAB,
{{{pl}}} for Perl. For output in {{{latex}}} one can let {{{xxx}}} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the {{{ptex2tex}}} configuration file
({{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}). For {{{sphinx}}} output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments ({{{xxx}}}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what {{{sphinx}}} applies to typeset computer code).

The {{{xxx}}} specifier has only effect for {{{latex}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
}}}
The {{{@@@CODE}}} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file {{{doconce_program.sh}}}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the //regular
expression// {{{doconce clean}}} up to, but not including the line
matching the //regular expression// {{{^doconce split_rst}}}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside {{{!bc shpro}}}
and {{{!ec}}} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become {{{!bc shcod}}} and {{{!ec}}} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension {{{.X}}}, the environment
becomes {{{!bc Xpro}}} or {{{!bc Xcod}}} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ({{{Xcod}}} and {{{Xpro}}}) are only active
for {{{latex}}} and {{{sphinx}}} outout.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}},
pdflatex`, {{{pandoc}}}, and {{{mwiki}}} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
{{{Ax=b}}}. To help increase readability in other formats than {{{sphinx}}},
{{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
{{{!bt}}}
and
{{{!et}}} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the {{{sphinx}}}, {{{pandoc}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{html}}}, or {{{ipynb}}} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


  * Use only the equation environments {{{\[}}}, {{{\]}}},    {{{equation}}}, {{{equation*}}}, {{{align}}}, and {{{align*}}}.
  * MediaWiki ({{{mwiki}}}) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to {{{sphinx}}} and other formats such that
labels in {{{align}}} environments work well.)

//Notice.// 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as {{{sphinx}}}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically {{{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}}}) to
include special code for {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



//LaTeX Newcommands.// The author can define {{{newcommand}}} statements in files with names
{{{newcommands*.tex}}}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in {{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{ipynb}}}, and {{{pandoc}}}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


== Hyperlinks ==

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

== Figures and Movies ==

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between {{{width}}}, {{{height}}}, and {{{frac}}} and no spaces    around the {{{=}}} characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The {{{width}}}
and {{{height}}} parameters affect HTML formats ({{{html}}}, {{{rst}}}, {{{sphinx}}}),
while {{{frac}}} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies {{{montage}}} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in {{{html}}} and {{{sphinx}}} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. [[http://vimeo.com/55562330]]


== Tables ==

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option {{{--tables2csv}}} (to {{{doconce format}}})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file {{{table_X.csv}}},
where {{{X}}} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

== Labels and References ==

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose {{{name}}}
as some hierarchical name, say {{{a:b:c}}}, where {{{a}}} and {{{b}}} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
{{{c}}} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label {{{name}}} is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before {{{ref}}}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


== Citations and Bibliography ==

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where {{{name}}} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have {{{name}}} on the form
{{{Author1_Author2_YYYY}}}, {{{Author_YYYY}}}, or {{{Author1_etal_YYYY}}}, where
{{{YYYY}}} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line {{{BIBFILE: papers.pub}}},
where {{{papers.pub}}} is a publication database in the
[[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish|Publish]] format.
BibTeX {{{.bib}}} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

== Generalized Citations ==

There is a //generalized referencing// feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with {{{ref}}} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text {{{internal}}} if all
{{{label}}} references in {{{internal}}} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
{{{latex}}} or {{{pdflatex}}} one assumes that the references in {{{internal}}}
are to external documents declared by a comment line {{{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc}}} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is {{{internal cite}}} and the
LaTeX package {{{xr}}} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
{{{external}}} text will be the output.

== Index of Keywords ==

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the {{{latex}}},
{{{pdflatex}}}, {{{rst}}}, and {{{sphinx}}} formats.

== Capabilities of The Program {{{doconce}}} ==

The {{{doconce}}} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a {{{.do.txt}}} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

}}}

== Exercises ==

Doconce supports //Exercise//, //Problem//, //Project//, and //Example//.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain //elements//:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments {{{--without_answers}}} and {{{--without_solutions}}}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


== Environments ==

Doconce environments start with {{{!benvirname}}} and end with {{{!eenvirname}}},
where {{{envirname}}} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * {{{c}}}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * {{{t}}}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * {{{subex}}}: sub-exercise
 * {{{ans}}}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{sol}}}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{quote}}}: indented text
 * {{{notice}}}, {{{summary}}}, {{{warning}}}, {{{question}}}, {{{hint}}}: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * {{{pop}}}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * {{{slidecell}}}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

== Preprocessing ==

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either {{{preprocess}}} and/or
{{{mako}}}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The {{{mako}}} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command {{{doconce format}}} first runs {{{preprocess}}} and then {{{mako}}}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing {{{preprocess}}} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the {{{mako}}} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [[http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/|example document]] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize {{{mako}}} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the {{{doc/src/make.sh}}} script).

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"



************** File: quickref.st *****************
TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's 'blogger.com', Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format 'latex' and 'pdflatex')
 - HTML (format 'html')
 - reStructuredText (format 'rst')
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format 'plain')
 - Sphinx (format 'sphinx')
 - IPython notebook (format 'ipynb')
 - MediaWiki (format 'mwiki')
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format 'pandoc')
 - Googlecode wiki (format 'gwiki')
 - Creoloe wiki (format 'cwiki')
 - Epydoc (format 'epydoc')
 - StructuredText (format 'st')

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', and 'html'; and to a slightly
less extent 'mwiki' and 'pandoc'. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support

The file "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el":.doconce-mode.el
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
'(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")' to the '.emacs' file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  
            Emacs key                             Action                
==================================  ==================================

==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the '&' keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword 'and' works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from 'today' if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., 'Jan 32, 2100'.

The table of contents is removed by writing 'TOC: off'.


Section Types

===========================================  ===========================================  
                Section type                                    Syntax                    
===========================================  ===========================================  
chapter                                      '========= Heading ========' (9 '=')         
section                                      '======= Heading ======='    (7 '=')         
subsection                                   '===== Heading ====='        (5 '=')         
subsubsection                                '=== Heading ==='            (3 '=')         
paragraph                                    '__Heading.__'               (2 '_')         
abstract                                     '__Abstract.__' Running text...              
appendix                                     '======= Appendix: heading =======' (7 '=')  
appendix                                     '===== Appendix: heading =====' (5 '=')      
exercise                                     '======= Exercise: heading =======' (7 '=')  
exercise                                     '===== Exercise: heading =====' (5 '=')      
===========================================  ===========================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with '__Abstract.__' or
'__Summary.__' at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more '=' signs of the next heading.

The 'Exercise:' keyword kan be substituted by 'Problem:' or 'Project:'.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by '*' are emphasized: '*emphasized words*' becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: '_boldface_' becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with '*', *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with 'o' and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with '-' followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: --  
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 keyword2: --  
   followed by text on the next line
 keyword3: --  
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines

Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats 'rst' and
'sphinx' are desired.

Comment lines starting with '##' are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
'# #ifdef EXTRA' and '# #endif' around the text. The command line
option '-DEXTRA' will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where 'name' is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and 'running text' is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the '-DTOTONOTES' option to 'ptex2tex' or 'doconce ptex2tex',
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the 'todonotes' package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with 'words in verbatim style'.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between '!bc xxx' and '!ec' directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification 'xxx' indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for 'xxx' are
nothing, 'cod' for a code snippet, 'pro' for a complete program,
'sys' for a terminal session, 'dat' for a data file (or output from a
program),
'Xpro' or 'Xcod' for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming 'X', where 'X' may be 'py' for Python,
'cy' for Cython, 'sh' for Bash or other Unix shells,
'f' for Fortran, 'c' for C, 'cpp' for C++, 'm' for MATLAB,
'pl' for Perl. For output in 'latex' one can let 'xxx' reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the 'ptex2tex' configuration file
('.ptex2tex.cfg'). For 'sphinx' output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments ('xxx') onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what 'sphinx' applies to typeset computer code).

The 'xxx' specifier has only effect for 'latex' and
'sphinx' output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The '@@@CODE' identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file 'doconce_program.sh'.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* 'doconce clean' up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* '^doconce split_rst'.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside '!bc shpro'
and '!ec' directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become '!bc shcod' and '!ec' when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension '.X', the environment
becomes '!bc Xpro' or '!bc Xcod' for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ('Xcod' and 'Xpro') are only active
for 'latex' and 'sphinx' outout.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex',
pdflatex`, 'pandoc', and 'mwiki' work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than 'sphinx',
'latex', and 'pdflatex', inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
'!bt'
and
'!et' (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the 'sphinx', 'pandoc',
'mwiki', 'html', or 'ipynb' formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  - Use only the equation environments '\[', '\]',
    'equation', 'equation*', 'align', and 'align*'.
  - MediaWiki ('mwiki') does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to 'sphinx' and other formats such that
labels in 'align' environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as 'sphinx', makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically 'if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")') to
include special code for 'latex' and 'pdflatex' output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define 'newcommand' statements in files with names
'newcommands*.tex'. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that 'newcommands_keep.tex'
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in 'newcommands_replace.tex' will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex', 'pdflatex',
'mwiki', 'ipynb', and 'pandoc', the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between 'width', 'height', and 'frac' and no spaces
    around the '=' characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The 'width'
and 'height' parameters affect HTML formats ('html', 'rst', 'sphinx'),
while 'frac' is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the 'latex' and 'pdflatex' formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies 'montage' or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in 'html' and 'sphinx' documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. "http://vimeo.com/55562330":http://vimeo.com/55562330


Tables

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option '--tables2csv' (to 'doconce format')
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file 'table_X.csv',
where 'X' is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose 'name'
as some hierarchical name, say 'a:b:c', where 'a' and 'b' indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
'c' is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label 'name' is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before 'ref'.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where 'name' is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have 'name' on the form
'Author1_Author2_YYYY', 'Author_YYYY', or 'Author1_etal_YYYY', where
'YYYY' is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line 'BIBFILE: papers.pub',
where 'papers.pub' is a publication database in the
"https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish":Publish format.
BibTeX '.bib' files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with 'ref' to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text 'internal' if all
'ref{label}' references in 'internal' are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
'latex' or 'pdflatex' one assumes that the references in 'internal'
are to external documents declared by a comment line '#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc' (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is 'internal cite' and the
LaTeX package 'xr' is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
'external' text will be the output.

Index of Keywords

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the 'latex',
'pdflatex', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats.

Capabilities of The Program 'doconce'

The 'doconce' program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a '.do.txt' file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments '--without_answers' and '--without_solutions'
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments

Doconce environments start with '!benvirname' and end with '!eenvirname',
where 'envirname' is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - 'c': computer code (or verbatim text)
 - 't': math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - 'subex': sub-exercise
 - 'ans': short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'sol': full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'quote': indented text
 - 'notice', 'summary', 'warning', 'question', 'hint': admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - 'pop': text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - 'slidecell': indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either 'preprocess' and/or
'mako'. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The 'mako' preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command 'doconce format' first runs 'preprocess' and then 'mako'.
Here is a typical example on utilizing 'preprocess' to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the 'mako' preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/":example document contains
some illustrations on how to utilize 'mako' (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the 'doc/src/make.sh' script).

TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
B{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

I{Mission.} Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code I{once, in one place} and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's C{blogger.com}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format C{latex} and C{pdflatex})
 - HTML (format C{html})
 - reStructuredText (format C{rst})
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format C{plain})
 - Sphinx (format C{sphinx})
 - IPython notebook (format C{ipynb})
 - MediaWiki (format C{mwiki})
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format C{pandoc})
 - Googlecode wiki (format C{gwiki})
 - Creoloe wiki (format C{cwiki})
 - Epydoc (format C{epydoc})
 - StructuredText (format C{st})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{sphinx}, and C{html}; and to a slightly
less extent C{mwiki} and C{pandoc}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file U{.doconce-mode.el<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>}
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
C{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")} to the C{.emacs} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  
            Emacs key                             Action                
==================================  ==================================  
Ctrl+c f                            figure                              
Ctrl+c v                            movie/video

Ctrl+c h2                           heading level 2 (subsection/h2)     
Ctrl+c h3                           heading level 2 (subsection/h3)

Ctrl+c slide                        slide outline                       
Ctrl+c help                         print this table                    
==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the C{&} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword C{and} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from C{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., C{Jan 32, 2100}.

The table of contents is removed by writing C{TOC: off}.


Section Types
-------------

=============================================  =============================================  
                 Section type                                      Syntax                     
=============================================  =============================================  
chapter                                        C{========= Heading ========} (9 C{=})         
section                                        C{======= Heading =======}    (7 C{=})         
subsection                                     C{===== Heading =====}        (5 C{=})         
subsubsection                                  C{=== Heading ===}            (3 C{=})         
paragraph                                      C{__Heading.__}               (2 C{_})         
abstract                                       C{__Abstract.__} Running text...               
appendix                                       C{======= Appendix: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
appendix                                       C{===== Appendix: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
exercise                                       C{======= Exercise: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
exercise                                       C{===== Exercise: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
=============================================  =============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with C{__Abstract.__} or
C{__Summary.__} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more C{=} signs of the next heading.

The C{Exercise:} keyword kan be substituted by C{Problem:} or C{Project:}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by C{*} are emphasized: C{*emphasized words*} becomes
I{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: C{_boldface_} becomes B{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: I{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with C{*}, I{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with C{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and I{description} lists, where each item starts with C{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with C{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats C{rst} and
C{sphinx} are desired.

Comment lines starting with C{##} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
C{# #ifdef EXTRA} and C{# #endif} around the text. The command line
option C{-DEXTRA} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where C{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and C{running text} is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the C{-DTOTONOTES} option to C{ptex2tex} or C{doconce ptex2tex},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the C{todonotes} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with C{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between C{!bc xxx} and C{!ec} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification C{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for C{xxx} are
nothing, C{cod} for a code snippet, C{pro} for a complete program,
C{sys} for a terminal session, C{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
C{Xpro} or C{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming C{X}, where C{X} may be C{py} for Python,
C{cy} for Cython, C{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
C{f} for Fortran, C{c} for C, C{cpp} for C++, C{m} for MATLAB,
C{pl} for Perl. For output in C{latex} one can let C{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the C{ptex2tex} configuration file
(C{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For C{sphinx} output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (C{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what C{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The C{xxx} specifier has only effect for C{latex} and
C{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The C{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file C{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the I{regular
expression} C{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the I{regular expression} C{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside C{!bc shpro}
and C{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become C{!bc shcod} and C{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension C{.X}, the environment
becomes C{!bc Xpro} or C{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (C{Xcod} and C{Xpro}) are only active
for C{latex} and C{sphinx} outout.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex},
pdflatex`, C{pandoc}, and C{mwiki} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
M{Ax=b}. To help increase readability in other formats than C{sphinx},
C{latex}, and C{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
C{!bt}
and
C{!et} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



This LaTeX code gets rendered as::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Here is a single equation::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


which results in::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the C{sphinx}, C{pandoc},
C{mwiki}, C{html}, or C{ipynb} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  - Use only the equation environments C{\[}, C{\]},
    C{equation}, C{equation*}, C{align}, and C{align*}.
  - MediaWiki (C{mwiki}) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to C{sphinx} and other formats such that
labels in C{align} environments work well.)

I{Notice.} 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as C{sphinx}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically C{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
include special code for C{latex} and C{pdflatex} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



I{LaTeX Newcommands.} The author can define C{newcommand} statements in files with names
C{newcommands*.tex}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that C{newcommands_keep.tex}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in C{newcommands_replace.tex} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex}, C{pdflatex},
C{mwiki}, C{ipynb}, and C{pandoc}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between C{width}, C{height}, and C{frac} and no spaces
    around the C{=} characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The C{width}
and C{height} parameters affect HTML formats (C{html}, C{rst}, C{sphinx}),
while C{frac} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the C{latex} and C{pdflatex} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies C{montage} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in C{html} and C{sphinx} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. U{http://vimeo.com/55562330<http://vimeo.com/55562330>}


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option C{--tables2csv} (to C{doconce format})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file C{table_X.csv},
where C{X} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose C{name}
as some hierarchical name, say C{a:b:c}, where C{a} and C{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
C{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label C{name} is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before C{ref}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where C{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have C{name} on the form
C{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, C{Author_YYYY}, or C{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
C{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line C{BIBFILE: papers.pub},
where C{papers.pub} is a publication database in the
U{Publish<https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>} format.
BibTeX C{.bib} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a I{generalized referencing} feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with C{ref} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text C{internal} if all
C{ref{label}} references in C{internal} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
C{latex} or C{pdflatex} one assumes that the references in C{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line C{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is C{internal cite} and the
LaTeX package C{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
C{external} text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the C{latex},
C{pdflatex}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats.

Capabilities of The Program C{doconce}
--------------------------------------

The C{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a C{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports I{Exercise}, I{Problem}, I{Project}, and I{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain I{elements}:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments C{--without_answers} and C{--without_solutions}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with C{!benvirname} and end with C{!eenvirname},
where C{envirname} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - C{c}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 - C{t}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - C{subex}: sub-exercise
 - C{ans}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{sol}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{quote}: indented text
 - C{notice}, C{summary}, C{warning}, C{question}, C{hint}: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - C{pop}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - C{slidecell}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either C{preprocess} and/or
C{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The C{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command C{doconce format} first runs C{preprocess} and then C{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing C{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



With the C{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An U{example document<http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize C{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the C{doc/src/make.sh} script).

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's blogger.com, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format latex and pdflatex)

 * HTML (format html)

 * reStructuredText (format rst)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format plain)

 * Sphinx (format sphinx)

 * IPython notebook (format ipynb)

 * MediaWiki (format mwiki)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format pandoc)

 * Googlecode wiki (format gwiki)

 * Creoloe wiki (format cwiki)

 * Epydoc (format epydoc)

 * StructuredText (format st)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are latex, pdflatex, sphinx, and html; and to a slightly
less extent mwiki and pandoc. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file .doconce-mode.el (https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el") to the .emacs file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the & keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword and works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from today if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., Jan 32, 2100.

The table of contents is removed by writing TOC: off.

exercise                                 ======= Exercise: heading ======= (7 =)  
exercise                                 ===== Exercise: heading ===== (5 =)      
=======================================  =======================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with __Abstract.__ or
*Summary.* at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more = signs of the next heading.

The Exercise: keyword kan be substituted by Problem: or Project:.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by * are emphasized: *emphasized words* becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: _boldface_ becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with *, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with o and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with - followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with # are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats rst and
sphinx are desired.

Comment lines starting with ## are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
# #ifdef EXTRA and # #endif around the text. The command line
option -DEXTRA will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where name is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and running text is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the -DTOTONOTES option to ptex2tex or doconce ptex2tex,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the todonotes package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with words in verbatim style.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between !bc xxx and !ec directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification xxx indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for xxx are
nothing, cod for a code snippet, pro for a complete program,
sys for a terminal session, dat for a data file (or output from a
program),
Xpro or Xcod for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming X, where X may be py for Python,
cy for Cython, sh for Bash or other Unix shells,
f for Fortran, c for C, cpp for C++, m for MATLAB,
pl for Perl. For output in latex one can let xxx reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ptex2tex configuration file
(.ptex2tex.cfg). For sphinx output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (xxx) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what sphinx applies to typeset computer code).

The xxx specifier has only effect for latex and
sphinx output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The @@@CODE identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file doconce_program.sh.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* doconce clean up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ^doconce split_rst.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside !bc shpro
and !ec directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become !bc shcod and !ec when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension .X, the environment
becomes !bc Xpro or !bc Xcod for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (Xcod and Xpro) are only active
for latex and sphinx outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats html, sphinx, latex,
pdflatex`, pandoc, and mwiki work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than sphinx,
latex, and pdflatex, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
  !bt
and
  !et (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the sphinx, pandoc,
mwiki, html, or ipynb formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments \[, \],
    equation, equation*, align, and align*.

  * MediaWiki (mwiki) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to sphinx and other formats such that
labels in align environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as sphinx, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")) to
include special code for latex and pdflatex output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define newcommand statements in files with names
newcommands*.tex. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that newcommands_keep.tex
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in newcommands_replace.tex will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For html, sphinx, latex, pdflatex,
mwiki, ipynb, and pandoc, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between width, height, and frac and no spaces
    around the = characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The width
and height parameters affect HTML formats (html, rst, sphinx),
while frac is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the latex and pdflatex formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies montage or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in html and sphinx documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

 Vimeo movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option --tables2csv (to doconce format)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file table_X.csv,
where X is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose name
as some hierarchical name, say a:b:c, where a and b indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
c is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label name is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ref.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where name is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have name on the form
Author1_Author2_YYYY, Author_YYYY, or Author1_etal_YYYY, where
YYYY is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line BIBFILE: papers.pub,
where papers.pub is a publication database in the
Publish (https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX .bib files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ref to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text internal if all
ref{label} references in internal are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
latex or pdflatex one assumes that the references in internal
are to external documents declared by a comment line #
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is internal cite and the
LaTeX package xr is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
external text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the latex,
pdflatex, rst, and sphinx formats.

Capabilities of The Program doconce
-----------------------------------

The doconce program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a .do.txt file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments --without_answers and --without_solutions
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with !benvirname and end with !eenvirname,
where envirname is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * c: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * t: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * subex: sub-exercise

 * ans: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * sol: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * quote: indented text

 * notice, summary, warning, question, hint: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * pop: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * slidecell: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either preprocess and/or
mako. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The mako preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command doconce format first runs preprocess and then mako.
Here is a typical example on utilizing preprocess to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the mako preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An example document (http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize mako (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the doc/src/make.sh script).

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"


************** File: quickref.md *****************
% Doconce Quick Reference
% Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
% Jan 32, 2100

<!-- Table of contents: Run pandoc with --toc option -->



_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

### Supported Formats

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)

 * HTML (format `html`)

 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)

 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)

 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)

 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)

 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)

 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)

 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)

 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


### Emacs syntax support

The file [.doconce-mode.el](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


            Emacs key                             Action                
----------------------------------  ----------------------------------

Ctrl+c help                         print this table                    


### Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


### Section Types


                Section type                                    Syntax                    
-------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------  
chapter                                      `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         
section                                      `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         
subsection                                   `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         
subsubsection                                `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         
paragraph                                    `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         
abstract                                     `__Abstract.__` Running text...              
appendix                                     `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  
appendix                                     `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      
exercise                                     `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  
exercise                                     `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

### Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`color{red}{two red words}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

### Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1:
  :    
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2:
  :    
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3:
  :    
   and its description may fit on one line

### Comment lines

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


### Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[name: running text]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

### LaTeX Mathematics

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$
Here is a single equation:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which results in

$$
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
$$

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.

  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


### Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latter results in


<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>




### Tables

The table in the section [Section Types](#s) was written with this
syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

### Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\label{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ref{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


### Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name1,name2,name3}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[Publish](https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

### Generalized Citations

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`ref{label}` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

### Index of Keywords

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
index{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

### Capabilities of The Program `doconce`

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Exercises

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


### Environments

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * `subex`: sub-exercise

 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * `quote`: indented text

 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

### Preprocessing

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... \label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [example document](http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.1]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir-math
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making tmp_admon
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file tmp_admon/conf.py.
Creating file tmp_admon/index.rst.
Creating file tmp_admon/Makefile.
Creating file tmp_admon/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file tmp_admon/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.7]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
