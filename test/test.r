__Abstract.__
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

# Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
# is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

======= Section 1 =======
label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2
  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
    o first item
    o second item,
      continuing on a new line

!bquote
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.
!equote

Here is a reference to Equation (ref{my:eq1}).
# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html")
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.
# #endif


===== Subsection 1 =====
label{subsec1}

idx{`somefunc` function}

# Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
# and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section ref{sec1} and ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections    ref{subsec1} and ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises ref{demo:ex:1} and ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices     ref{app1} and ref{app2} are also nice elements.


# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

=== Computer code ===

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f fromto: subroutine@
and then just the subroutine,
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f from-to:a comment@^C\s+END1
and finally the complete file:
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f

Testing other code environments. First Python:
!bc
|bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
|ec
!ec
which gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec

# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html", "latex", "pdflatex")
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:
# #else
Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.
# #endif

!bc pyoptpro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
!ec

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:
# #else
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).
# #endif

!bc pyscpro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
!ec

## Should also test that one can read .pyopt and .pysc programs

Then Cython:
!bc cycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
!ec

# This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
!bc cpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
!ec
# The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

!bc
|bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
|ec
!ec
which then is typeset as

!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec

HTML:

!bc htmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
!ec

System call:
!bc sys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
!ec

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in `a != b`,
and a Doconce directive a la `!bc`.

Here is some color{red}{red} color and an attempt to write color{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. <linebreak>
And one more.} Some formats will only display <linebreak>
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <linebreak>
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

=== Running OS commands ===

@@@OSCMD python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'

===== Subsection 2: Testing figures =====
label{subsec:ex}
idx{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. label{fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

idx{movies}


# Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long
caption spanning
several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`
as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. label{myfig}

# Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

# Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs
# #if FORMAT == "mwiki"
FIGURE: [testfigs/df_plot.png, width=800] This is a wikimedia figure file.

# Non-uploaded file with no caption
FIGURE: [testfigs/df2s8765s_plot.png, width=200, frac=0.4]
# #endif


__Remark.__
Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


# Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

===== The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?) =====
label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
!bc
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
!ec

__More on $\theta$.__ Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}
!et

Or with align with label and numbers:

!bt
\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
!et

% if FORMAT == "sphinx":
Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.
% endif
% if FORMAT == "mwiki":
The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.
% endif

===== Custom Environments =====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.


===== Tables =====
label{subsec:table}

idx{test index with `verbatim text` which is possible}
idx{test `two` (separate) `verbatim expressions` which is also possible}
idx{index with!subindex}

# index with comma could fool sphinx
idx{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in LaTeX, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
label{mytab}
}

% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\end{table}
% endif

The Doconce source code reads
!bc ccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

|--------------------------|
|$i$|$h_i$|$\bar T_i$|`L_i`|
|-l-----r-------r----r-----|
|0   |0     |288   |-0.0065|
|1   |11,000|216   |0.0	   |
|2   |20,000|216   |0.001  |
|3   |32,000|228   |0.0028 |
|4   |47,000|270   |0.0	   |
|5   |51,000|270   |-0.0028|
|6   |71,000|214   |`NaN`  |
|--------------------------|

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):
## +`v_2` does not work, need space + `v_2`

|-----------------------------------------|
| exact | `v_1`   |$a_i$ + `v_2`|`verb_3_`|
|---r--------r---------r-----------r------|
|9      | 9.62    | 5.57      |  8.98     |
|-20    | -23.39  | -7.65     | -19.93    |
|10     | 17.74   | -4.50     |  9.96     |
|0      | -9.19   | 4.13      | -0.26     |
|-----------------------------------------|

Finally, a table with math
# #if FORMAT in ("rst", "html", "sphinx", "pandoc")
(`bm` that expands to `boldsymbol`, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
# #endif
and URLs.

# Mako code to expand URLs in the table
# (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)
<%
def tfig(fileno):
    p = '../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0' + fileno + '.png'  # path
    if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
        text = r'\includegraphics[width=2cm]{%s}' % p
    elif FORMAT == "html":
        text = '<a href="%s"><img src="%s" width="300"></a>' % (p, p)
    else:
        text = '"`%s`": "%s"' % (fileno, p)  # plain link

===== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` =====

__Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.__ Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)'';
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like `.txt`.


===== Bibliography test =====

Here is an example: cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work cite{Langtangen_1988d} and cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book cite{Langtangen:91} and the
cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.


===== Example: Examples can be typeset as exercises =====
label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


!bsubex
State some problem.

!bsol
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
State some other problem.

!bhint
A hint can be given.
!ehint

!bhint
Maybe even another hint?
!ehint

!bsol
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.
!esol
!esubex


===== URLs =====
label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl", or
the entire URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".  Here is a
plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt", or
URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link with
newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or "hpl" :
"http://folk.uio.no/hpl". Also `file:///` works: "link to a
file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or just a "mail link": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or a raw URL: "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
"Newton-Cotes":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" formulas
and a "good book":
"http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1". Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas"
and URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
"`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py", "`ball1.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py",
and "`ball2.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py".


# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
# format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

# Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
# if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
"google": "http://google.com", "google": "http://google.com", and
"google": "http://google.com", which should result in exactly three
footnotes.


% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):

===== Test of Some LaTeX Fixes =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen,
or maybe also prof. Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch. ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App. ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no. $i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.

!split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

======= LaTeX Mathematics =======

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
!et


% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', 'html', 'pandoc'):
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
!bt
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
Testing split:
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to the last equation by (ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
!bt
\begin{gather}
a = b \\
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
!et

Testing alignat:
!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 label{eq1a} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
!et
Let us refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (ref{eq1a})-(ref{eq2a}), and to (ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
% endif

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem ref{demo:ex:1} and Project ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects ref{proj:circle1} and ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise ref{exer:some:formula}.

To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
!ehint

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

 o item1
 o item2

===== Project: Explore Distributions of Random Circles =====

label{proj:circle1}
file=circles.pdf

The formula for a circle is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
!et
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
!ec

# Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
# which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

!bsubex
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

!bans
Here goes the short answer to part a).

!bhint
Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.
!ehint

!esubex

!bsubex
Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.

!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
Some final closing remarks, e.g., summarizing the main findings
and their implications in other problems can be made. These
remarks will appear at the end of the typeset exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
With some math $a=b$ in this solution:
!bt
\[ \hbox{math in solution: } a = b \]
!et
And code `a=b` in this solution:
!bc
a = b  # code in solution
!ec
End of solution is here.
!esol

#  No meaning in this weired test example:
The text here belongs to the main (intro) part of the exercise. Need
closing remarks to have text after subexercises.

Test list in exercise:

 o item1
 o item2


===== {Exercise}: Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix =====

# Another minimalistic exercise

Just some text. And some math saying that $e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

!bt
\[ \exp{(0)} = 1 \]
!et

And a test that the code `lambda x: x+2` is correctly placed here:

!bc
lambda x: x+2
!ec

# Have some comments at the end of the exercise to see that
# the Filename: ... is written correctly.

===== Example: Just an example =====

# This example needs the --examples_as_exercises option, otherwise
# it is just typeset as it is written.

!bsubex

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "Script for Introduction to Version Control":
"http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

!esummary

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "Dropbox":
"http://dropbox.com" and "Google Drive": "http://drive.google.com".
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


===== Appendix: Testing inline comments =====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl:
not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to URL:"http://dropbox.com" and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade {\LaTeX} (from Doconce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}



\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.
\end{quote}


Here is a reference to Equation (\ref{my:eq1}).


\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.


% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file:
\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

System call:
\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

It is time to test \code{verbatim inline font} especially with \code{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \code{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \code{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \code{!bc} and \code{!ec} as well as \code{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like \code{\begin}, \code{\begin{enumerate}},
\code{\end{this}\end{that}}, and \code{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in {\LaTeX} inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in \code{a != b},
and a Doconce directive a la \code{!bc}.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. \\
And one more.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when HTML is the output format. \\
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\bsys
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'

\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
\end{center}


\index{movies}


% Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \code{my\_file\_v1} and \protect \code{my\_file\_v2} as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}
\end{center}


% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \code{movies.do.txt}.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \code{.tex} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{

with the preprocessor.

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: \protect\code{my\_file\_v1} and \protect\code{my\_file\_v2} }

\paragraph{Files \protect\code{my\_file\_v1.py} and \protect\code{my\_file\_v2.py} define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)'';
written in the standard {\LaTeX}-style that gives correct
{\LaTeX} formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-{\LaTeX} formats.
Here is another sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like \code{.txt}.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \code{file:///} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \code{latex} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \code{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the \code{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \code{_static*} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\code{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \code{CG-2}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \code{n} points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \code{circle} function

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. \longinlinecomment{mp 2}{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} and watch the video. It explains
how files, like \code{myfile.py}, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines. }{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} } It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\code{verbatim inline} }

The point here is to test 1) \code{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \code{admon.do.txt}.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade \textsc{pdf}{\LaTeX} (from Doconce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}

\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

% sphinx code--blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}
\noindent

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{minted}
\noindent

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{minted}
\noindent


Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}
\noindent

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
\noindent
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
which then is typeset as

It is time to test \texttt{verbatim inline font} especially with \texttt{a newline inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \texttt{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \texttt{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test {\Verb~!bc~} and {\Verb~!ec~} as well as {\Verb~!bsummary~}.
Also test backslashes and braces like {\Verb!\begin!}, {\Verb!\begin{enumerate}!},
{\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!}, and {\Verb!{something \inside braces}!} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in {\LaTeX} inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in {\Verb~a != b~},
and a Doconce directive a la {\Verb~!bc~}.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. \\
And one more.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when HTML is the output format. \\
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}\marginpar{\footnotesize figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[ht]

%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

\end{center}


\index{movies}\marginpar{\footnotesize movies}


% Test multi--line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi--line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1!} and {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2!} as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \texttt{.tex} by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}\marginpar{\footnotesize index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}

\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\Verb!L\_i!} } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\
5          & 51,000     & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6          & 71,000     & 214        & \texttt{NaN} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \texttt{|-} because of a negative number,
and \texttt{|} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\Verb!v\_1!} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + {\Verb!v\_2!} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ {\Verb!verb\_3\_!} } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\
-20                & -23.39             & -7.65              & -19.93             \\
10                 & 17.74              & -4.50              & 9.96               \\
0                  & -9.19              & 4.13               & -0.26              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1!} and {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2!} }

\paragraph{Files {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1.py!} and {\protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2.py!} define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double--quote)'';
written in the standard {\LaTeX}-style that gives correct
{\LaTeX} formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-{\LaTeX} formats.
Here is another sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like \texttt{.txt}.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

% --- end exercise ---


\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also \texttt{file:///} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \texttt{latex} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \texttt{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the {\Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!}
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a {\Verb!_static*!} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\texttt{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well--known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \texttt{CG-2}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in {\LaTeX}
in previous Doconce versions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
% --- begin hint in exercise ---

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \texttt{random} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \texttt{n} points on a circle:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{minted}
\noindent

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \texttt{circle} function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly

how files, like \texttt{myfile.py}, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines. }{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} } It

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \texttt{verbatim inline} }

The point here is to test 1) \texttt{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \texttt{admon.do.txt}.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade \textsc{pdf}{\LaTeX} (from Doconce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}



\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.
\end{quote}


Here is a reference to Equation (\ref{my:eq1}).


\subsection{Subsection 1}

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.


% sphinx code--blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{python:nt}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{python:nt}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{python:nt}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{python:nt}


Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which then is typeset as

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\end{Verbatim}

HTML:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{html}
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\end{minted}

System call:
begin{quote}begin{Verbatim}
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
end{Verbatim}end{quote}

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \Verb!Verb! typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \Verb~!bc~ and \Verb~!ec~ as well as \Verb~!bsummary~.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}! in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in {\LaTeX} inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in \Verb~a != b~,
and a Doconce directive a la \Verb~!bc~.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. \\
And one more.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when HTML is the output format. \\
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
begin{quote}begin{Verbatim}
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'

Python.
end{Verbatim}end{quote}


\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}\marginpar{\footnotesize figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}


\index{movies}\marginpar{\footnotesize movies}


% Test multi--line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi--line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v2! as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}
\end{center}


% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \Verb!movies.do.txt!.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}\marginpar{\footnotesize index with: subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}\marginpar{\footnotesize index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{Verbatim}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\
3          & 32,000     & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4          & 47,000     & 270        & 0.0        \\
5          & 51,000     & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6          & 71,000     & 214        & \Verb!NaN! \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \Verb!|-! because of a negative number,
and \Verb!|! right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!v\_1! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \Verb!v\_2! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!verb\_3\_! } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\
-20                & -23.39             & -7.65              & -19.93             \\
10                 & 17.74              & -4.50              & 9.96               \\
0                  & -9.19              & 4.13               & -0.26              \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2! }

\paragraph{Files \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1.py! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2.py! define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double--quote)'';
written in the standard {\LaTeX}-style that gives correct
{\LaTeX} formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-{\LaTeX} formats.
Here is another sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well--known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\begin{python:nt}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{python:nt}

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline! }

The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in ``a != b``,
and a Doconce directive a la ``!bc``.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. 

| And one more.</font> Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
| But here some more running text is added which is not part of

the previous blocks with line breaks.

.. _subsec:ex:

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure `fig:impact`_ in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*  (fig:impact)


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200





.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure `myfig`_ with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   *A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$*  (myfig)


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


Test URL as figure name:


.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs



**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)
----------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on \theta.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------


.. index with comma could fool sphinx


Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

========  ========  ========  ========  
   i        h_i     \bar T_i  ``L_i``   
========  ========  ========  ========  
0                0       288   -0.0065  
1           11,000       216       0.0  
2           20,000       216     0.001  
3           32,000       228    0.0028  
4           47,000       270       0.0  
5           51,000       270   -0.0028  
6           71,000       214   ``NaN``  
========  ========  ========  ========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=============  =============  =============  =============  
    exact         ``v_1``     a_i + ``v_2``   ``verb_3_``   
=============  =============  =============  =============  
            9           9.62           5.57           8.98  
          -20         -23.39          -7.65         -19.93  
           10          17.74          -4.50           9.96  
            0          -9.19           4.13          -0.26  
=============  =============  =============  =============  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

=========================================================  =========================================================  =========================================================  


A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Files ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math a_{i-1}.**
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like ``.txt``.


Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`_,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`_.


.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



.. !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment


LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have `Problem 2: Flip a Coin`_ and `Project 3: Compute a Probability`_,
as well as `Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles`_ and `Project 9: References in a headings do not work well in rst`_, and in

.. _demo:ex:1:

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------
.. keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation


.. Torture tests


Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





Remarks  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Use ``r = random.random()`` and define head as ``r <= 0.5``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---


.. --- begin answer of exercise ---

**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

.. _demo:ex:2:

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.


**a)**
Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Use the ``numpy.random`` module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: ``admon.do.txt``.

.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console


Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file:

.. code-block:: fortran

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as


.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1


Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:


.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>


Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:


.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran:


.. code-block:: text


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML:


.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in ``a != b``,
and a Doconce directive a la ``!bc``.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. 

| And one more.</font> Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
| But here some more running text is added which is not part of

the previous blocks with line breaks.

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

.. index:: figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200




.. index:: movies



.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


Test URL as figure name:


.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs



**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:


.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        


Or with align with label and numbers:


.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        



.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        


Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------


.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible


.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible


.. index::
   single: index with; subindex


.. index with comma could fool sphinx


.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more


Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads

.. code-block:: text

          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

================  ================  ================  ================  
   :math:`i`        :math:`h_i`     :math:`\bar T_i`      ``L_i``       
================  ================  ================  ================  
0                                0               288           -0.0065  
1                           11,000               216               0.0  
2                           20,000               216             0.001  
3                           32,000               228            0.0028  
4                           47,000               270               0.0  
5                           51,000               270           -0.0028

================  ================  ================  ================  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
        exact                 ``v_1``         :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``       ``verb_3_``       
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
                    9                   9.62                   5.57                   8.98  
                  -20                 -23.39                  -7.65                 -19.93  
                   10                  17.74                  -4.50                   9.96

=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript :math:`a_i`: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Files ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like ``.txt``.


Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`_,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`_.


.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



.. !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment


LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        



And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. math::
   :label: eq1
        
        a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        



.. math::
   :label: eq2
          
        b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Testing split:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

We can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

Testing gather:

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


Testing alignat:

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2` again, and to the
alignat variant :eq:`eq1a`-:eq:`eq2a`, and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Testing eqnarray:

.. math::
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
        


More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in
between there we have :ref:`exer:some:formula`.

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval :math:`[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw :math:`N` such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, :math:`M`, that fall in the interval :math:`(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as :math:`M/N`.

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by


.. math::
        
        x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
        



.. math::
          
        y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        

where :math:`R` is the radius of the circle, :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and :math:`t` is a parameter in the unit interval :math:`[0,1]`.
For any :math:`t`, :math:`(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle:


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw :math:`N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
:math:`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: ``admon.do.txt``.

The format of this document is
gwiki

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<wiki:comment> Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> is mutually exclusive in LaTeX </wiki:comment>

== Section 1 ==


Here is a nested list:


  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   # first item
   # second item,      continuing on a new line







Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).

<wiki:comment> sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console </wiki:comment>

==== Computer code ====

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

{{{
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}
and then just the subroutine,
{{{

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}
and finally the complete file:
{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
{{{
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
}}}
which gets rendered as

{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

{{{
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in `a != b`,
and a Doconce directive a la `!bc`.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. 

And one more.</font> Some formats will only display 

this correctly when HTML is the output format. 

But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

==== Running OS commands ====

{{{
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
}}}


==== Subsection 2: Testing figures ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure: 

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------





<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in `t_{i+1}`. (myfig) 

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>

Test URL as figure name:



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure: 

(the URL of the image file https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>


*Remark.* Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

==== The `\theta` parameter (not `\nabla`?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving `\theta`:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

*More on `\theta`.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
`\frac{1}{2}`, `{1/2}`, `\pmb{x}`, `\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



*Theorem 5.* Let `a=1` and `b=2`. Then `c=3`.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
*Proof.* Since `c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
`END`
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 ||      _time_       ||    _velocity_     ||  _acceleration_   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 ||      _time_       ||    _velocity_     ||  _acceleration_   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  1.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  3.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


 ||     _`i`_       ||    _`h_i`_      ||  _`\bar T_i`_   ||    _`L_i`_      ||
 ||  0              ||  0              ||  288            ||  -0.0065        ||
 ||  1              ||  11,000         ||  216            ||  0.0            ||
 ||  2              ||  20,000         ||  216            ||  0.001          ||

==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript `a_i`: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` ====

*Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math `a_{i-1}`.* Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like `.txt`.


==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also `file:///` works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no `hpl@simula.no`], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py `decay_mod`], [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py `ball1.py`],
and [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py `ball2.py`].


<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<wiki:comment> !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment </wiki:comment>

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

<wiki:comment> keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Torture tests </wiki:comment>

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin `N` times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

==== Project 3: Compute a Probability ====

<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval `[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:


# item1
# item2

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw `N` such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, `M`, that fall in the interval `(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as `M/N`.

==== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where `R` is the radius of the circle, `(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and `t` is a parameter in the unit interval `[0,1]`.
For any `t`, `(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw `N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.


*a)* Let `R` be normally distributed and `(x_0,y_0)` uniformly distributed.

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
`x_0`, `y_0`, and `R` quantities.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


==== Appendix: Testing inline comments ====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl:
not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  ===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

The format of this document is
mwiki

''Abstract.'' This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

== Section 1 ==


Here is a nested list:


<ul>
  <li> item1
  <li> item2
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  <li> and a sublist

<ul>
    <li><li> with indented subitem1
    <li><li> and a subitem2
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist

<ol>
   <li><li> first item
   <li><li> second item,
      continuing on a new line
</ol>

</ul>


{{quote box
| quote = Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.

Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).


==== Subsection 1 ====

<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

More text, with a reference back to
the section [#Section_1] and [#Subsection_1], and further to the
the sections [#Subsection_1] and [#URLs], which
encourages you to do the tasks in [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Exercise_8:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].
Appendices     [#Appendix:_Just_for_testing;_part_I] and [#Appendix:_Just_for_testing;_part_II] are also nice elements.


<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

==== Computer code ====

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and then just the subroutine,
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and finally the complete file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>

Testing other code environments. First Python:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which gets rendered as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x+1
</syntaxhighlight>

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
</syntaxhighlight>

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
</syntaxhighlight>


Then Cython:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:
<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp">
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
</syntaxhighlight>
<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which then is typeset as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</syntaxhighlight>

HTML:

<syntaxhighlight lang="html5">
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
</syntaxhighlight>

System call:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
</syntaxhighlight>

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>,
and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

==== Running OS commands ====

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
</syntaxhighlight>


==== Subsection 2: Testing figures ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|200px|alt=Wave1D.png|Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|200px|alt=Wave1D.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->




<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|500px|alt=Wave1D.png|A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in <math>t_{i+1}</math>. (myfig)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

Test URL as figure name:


[[File:f_plot.png|frame|500,px|link=https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog|alt=f_plot.png|<span title=""></span>]]


<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

    [[File:Df plot.png|frame|800px|alt=Df plot.png|This is a wikimedia figure file.]] <!-- user: Hplwp, filename: df_plot.png, timestamp: 2013-01-10T11:37:05Z -->


<!-- Non-uploaded file with no caption -->

[[File:Df2s8765s plot.png|frame|200,px|alt=Df2s8765s plot.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->



''Remark.''
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.


<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

==== The <math>\theta</math> parameter (not <math>\nabla</math>?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving <math>\theta</math>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</syntaxhighlight>

''More on <math>\theta</math>.''
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
<math>\frac{1}{2}</math>, <math>{1/2}</math>, <math>\pmb{x}</math>, <math>\frac{Du}{dt}</math>,
both inline and in block:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

Or with align with label and numbers:

:<math>
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align}
</math>

The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.

==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->



''Theorem 5.''
Let <math>a=1</math> and <math>b=2</math>. Then <math>c=3</math>.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
''Proof.''
Since <math>c=a+b</math>, the result follows from straightforward addition.
<math>\Diamond</math>
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:


<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>

The Doconce source code reads
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</syntaxhighlight>

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     <math>i</math>    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    <math>h_i</math>   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <math>\bar T_i</math> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    <code>L_i</code>   </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0                        </td> <td align="right">   0                        </td> <td align="right">   288                      </td> <td align="right">   -0.0065                  </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1                        </td> <td align="right">   11,000                   </td> <td align="right">   216                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0                      </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2                        </td> <td align="right">   20,000                   </td> <td align="right">   216                      </td> <td align="right">   0.001                    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3                        </td> <td align="right">   32,000                   </td> <td align="right">   228                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0028                   </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                        </td> <td align="right">   47,000                   </td> <td align="right">   270                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0                      </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                        </td> <td align="right">   51,000                   </td> <td align="right">   270                      </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028                  </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   6                        </td> <td align="right">   71,000                   </td> <td align="right">   214                      </td> <td align="right">   <code>NaN</code>         </td> </tr>
</table>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                exact                </b></td> <td align="center"><b>           <code>v_1</code>          </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <math>a_i</math> + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>         <code>verb_3_</code>        </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   9                                      </td> <td align="right">   9.62                                   </td> <td align="right">   5.57                                   </td> <td align="right">   8.98                                   </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   -20                                    </td> <td align="right">   -23.39                                 </td> <td align="right">   -7.65                                  </td> <td align="right">   -19.93                                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   10                                     </td> <td align="right">   17.74                                  </td> <td align="right">   -4.50                                  </td> <td align="right">   9.96                                   </td> </tr>

</table>
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->


<table border="1">
<tr></tr>
<tr><td align="center">   <math>\mathcal{L}=0</math>                                             </td> <td align="center">   [../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0080.png <code>080</code>]    </td> <td align="center">   [../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0085.png <code>085</code>]    </td> </tr>

</table>

==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript <math>a_i</math>: <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> ====

''Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math <math>a_{i-1}</math>.''
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.


==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


''a)''
State some problem.

''Solution.''
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also <code>file:///</code> works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no <code>hpl@simula.no</code>], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py <code>decay_mod</code>], [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py <code>ball1.py</code>],
and [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py <code>ball2.py</code>].


<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
:<math>
 a = b + c 
</math>
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
:<math>
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u </math>
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
:<math>
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
</math>



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_3:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_4:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_9:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_mwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_8:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].


== Exercises ==



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Problem 2: Flip a Coin ====

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin <math>N</math> times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





==== Remarks ====

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list


<ol>
<li> Mark 1.
<li> Mark 2.
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 1.''
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 2.''
Draw an integer among <math>\{1,2\}</math> with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number <math><1/2</math>, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this <math>N</math> number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
Code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->
Filenames: <code>flip_coin.py</code>, <code>flip_coin.pdf</code>.
<!-- solution files: mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


==== Not an exercise ====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 3: Compute a Probability ====

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval <math>[0,1)</math>?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw <math>N</math> such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, <math>M</math>, that fall in the interval <math>(0.5,0.6)</math>, and
compute the probability as <math>M/N</math>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

:<math>
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
</math>
where <math>R</math> is the radius of the circle, <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> is the
center point, and <math>t</math> is a parameter in the unit interval <math>[0,1]</math>.
For any <math>t</math>, <math>(x,y)</math> is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw <math>N</math> circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the <code>circle</code> function
above.


''a)''
Let <math>R</math> be normally distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
Use the <code>numpy.random</code> module to draw the
<math>x_0</math>, <math>y_0</math>, and <math>R</math> quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

''b)''
Let <math>R</math> be uniformly distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> normally distributed.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


==== Appendix: Testing inline comments ====

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
<math>\partial u/\partial t</math>, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

==== Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> ====

The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
{{{
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
}}}
which gets rendered as

{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

{{{
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

It is time to test {{{verbatim inline font}}} especially with {{{a newline
inside the text}}} and an exclamation mark at the end: {{{BEGIN}}}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the {{{Verb}}} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test {{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}} as well as {{{!bsummary}}}.
Also test backslashes and braces like {{{\begin}}}, {{{\begin{enumerate}}}},
{{{\end{this}\end{that}}}}, and {{{{something \inside braces}}}} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in {{{a != b}}},
and a Doconce directive a la {{{!bc}}}.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

=== Running OS commands ===

{{{
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
}}}


== Subsection 2: Testing figures ==


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png| Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)}}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png|}}



<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png| A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like {{{my_file_v1}}} and {{{my_file_v2}}} as well as math with subscript as in {{{t_{i+1}}}}. (myfig) }}

<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>

Test URL as figure name:

{{https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png|}}

<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>


//Remark.// Movies are tested in separate file {{{movies.do.txt}}}.


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

== The {{{\theta}}} parameter (not {{{\nabla}}}?) ==


Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving {{{\theta}}}:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

//More on {{{\theta}}}.// Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
{{{\frac{1}{2}}}}, {{{{1/2}}}}, {{{\pmb{x}}}}, {{{\frac{Du}{dt}}}},
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


== Custom Environments ==

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {{{.tex}}} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



//Theorem 5.// Let {{{a=1}}} and {{{b=2}}}. Then {{{c=3}}}.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
//Proof.// Since {{{c=a+b}}}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


== Tables ==



<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  4.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  1.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  3.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


 | ={{{i}}}            | ={{{h_i}}}          | ={{{\bar T_i}}}     | ={{{L_i}}}          |
 |  0                  |  0                  |  288                |  -0.0065            |
 |  1                  |  11,000             |  216                |  0.0                |
 |  2                  |  20,000             |  216                |  0.001              |
 |  3                  |  32,000             |  228                |  0.0028             |
 |  4                  |  47,000             |  270                |  0.0                |
 |  5                  |  51,000             |  270                |  -0.0028            |
 |  6                  |  71,000             |  214                |  {{{NaN}}}          |


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with {{{|-}}} because of a negative number,
and {{{|}}} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


 | =exact                     | ={{{v_1}}}                 | ={{{a_i}}} + {{{v_2}}}     | ={{{verb_3_}}}             |
 |  9                         |  9.62                      |  5.57                      |  8.98                      |
 |  -20                       |  -23.39                    |  -7.65                     |  -19.93                    |
 |  10                        |  17.74                     |  -4.50                     |  9.96                      |
 |  0                         |  -9.19                     |  4.13                      |  -0.26                     |


Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

<wiki:comment> Mako code to expand URLs in the table </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) </wiki:comment>



 | =                                                       | =                                                       | =                                                       |

 |  {{{a=b}}}                                              |  [[../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0090.png     |  {{{090}}}]]                                            |  [[../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0095.png     |  {{{095}}}]]                                            |
 |  {{{\nabla\cdot\bm{u} =0 }}}                            |  [[../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0100.png     |  {{{100}}}]]                                            |  [[../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0105.png     |  {{{105}}}]]                                            |



== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript {{{a_i}}}: {{{my_file_v1}}} and {{{my_file_v2}}} ==

//Files {{{my_file_v1.py}}} and {{{my_file_v2.py}}} define some math {{{a_{i-1}}}}.// Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like {{{.txt}}}.


== Bibliography test ==

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ==


Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with {{{Example:}}}
and then, with the command-line option {{{--examples_as_exercises}}} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


//a)// State some problem.

//Solution.// The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

//b)// State some other problem.

//Hint 1.// A hint can be given.

//Hint 2.// Maybe even another hint?

//Solution.// The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<wiki:comment> --- end exercise --- </wiki:comment>


== URLs ==


Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]], or
the entire URL if desired, [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]].  Here is a
plain file link [[testdoc.do.txt]], or [[testdoc.do.txt]], or
[[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt|a link with
newline]]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]] or [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]]. Also {{{file:///}}} works: [[file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html|link to a
file]] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]], if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|{{{hpl@simula.no}}}]], or just a [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|mail link]], or a raw [[mailto:hpl@simula.no]].

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the {{{latex}}} format:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas|Newton-Cotes]] formulas
and a [[http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1|good book]]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas]]
and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae]] which has a shebang.

For the {{{--device=paper}}} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the {{{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}}}
is used), as in this reference to
[[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py|{{{decay_mod}}}]], [[http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py|{{{ball1.py}}}]],
and [[http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py|{{{ball2.py}}}]].


<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a {{{_static*}}} folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
{{{--device=paper}}} option must be correct. We have
[[http://google.com|google]], [[http://google.com|google]], and
[[http://google.com|google]], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<wiki:comment> !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment </wiki:comment>

= LaTeX Mathematics =

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

== Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ==


The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where {{{R}}} is the radius of the circle, {{{(x_0,y_0)}}} is the
center point, and {{{t}}} is a parameter in the unit interval {{{[0,1]}}}.
For any {{{t}}}, {{{(x,y)}}} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {{{n}}} points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw {{{N}}} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the {{{circle}}} function
above.

//Tip.// 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [[http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/|Script for Introduction to Version Control]] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [[http://dropbox.com|Dropbox]] and [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


== Appendix: Testing inline comments ==

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to [[http://dropbox.com]] and watch the video. It explains
how files, like {{{myfile.py}}}, perhaps containing much math, like
{{{\partial u/\partial t}}}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

== Appendix: Testing headings ending with {{{verbatim inline}}} ==

The point here is to test 1) {{{verbatim}}} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: {{{admon.do.txt}}}.

The format of this document is
st
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.



Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line






Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).


Subsection 1



More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.



Computer code

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test 'verbatim inline font' especially with 'a newline
inside the text' and an exclamation mark at the end: 'BEGIN'! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the 'Verb' typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test '!bc' and '!ec' as well as '!bsummary'.
Also test backslashes and braces like '\begin', '\begin{enumerate}',
'\end{this}\end{that}', and '{something \inside braces}' in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in 'a != b',
and a Doconce directive a la '!bc'.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak. 
And one more. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands::


        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.



Subsection 2: Testing figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]




Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like 'my_file_v1' and 'my_file_v2' as well as math with subscript as in t_{i+1}. {myfig} 


Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]



*Remark.* Movies are tested in separate file 'movies.do.txt'.



The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the '.tex' by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.* Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::

          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01

3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

========  ========  ========  ========  
   i        h_i     \bar T_i   'L_i'

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: 'my_file_v1' and 'my_file_v2'

*Files 'my_file_v1.py' and 'my_file_v2.py' define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like '.txt'.


Bibliography test

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with 'Example:'
and then, with the command-line option '--examples_as_exercises' be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---


URLs

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl, or
the entire URL if desired, "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or
"testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":a link with
newline. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl or "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl. Also 'file:///' works: "file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html":link to a
file is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: mailto:hpl@simula.no:'hpl@simula.no', or just a "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mail link, or a raw "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the 'latex' format:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":Newton-Cotes formulas
and a "http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1":good book. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the '--device=paper' option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the '--latex_no_program_footnotelink'
is used), as in this reference to
https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py:'decay_mod', http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py:'ball1.py',
and http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py:'ball2.py'.




More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
'--device=paper' option must be correct. We have
"http://google.com":google, "http://google.com":google, and
"http://google.com":google, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for st", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".


Exercises



# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





Remarks

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 1.* Use 'r = random.random()' and define head as 'r <= 0.5'.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
'r = random.randint(1,2)' and define head when 'r' is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* If the 'random.random()' function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)


# --- end solution of exercise ---

Not an exercise

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

Project 3: Compute a Probability



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard 'random' module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---




# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate 'n' points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the 'circle' function
above.


*a)* Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* Use the 'numpy.random' module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)* Let R be uniformly distributed and (x_0,y_0) normally distributed.
Filename: 'norm.py'.

*c)* Let R and (x_0,y_0) be normally distributed.

At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives.

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/":Script for Introduction to Version Control provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "http://dropbox.com":Dropbox and "http://drive.google.com":Google Drive.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to "http://dropbox.com":http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like 'myfile.py', perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with 'verbatim inline'

The point here is to test 1) 'verbatim' code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: 'admon.do.txt'.

The format of this document is
epytext

I{Abstract.} This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.



Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line






Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).


Subsection 1
------------



More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.



Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test C{verbatim inline font} especially with C{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: C{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the C{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test C{!bc} and C{!ec} as well as C{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like C{\begin}, C{\begin{enumerate}},
C{\end{this}\end{that}}, and C{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in C{a != b},
and a Doconce directive a la C{!bc}.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak. 
And one more. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.




Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]




Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2} as well as math with subscript as in M{t_{i+1}}. {myfig} 


Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]



I{Remark.} Movies are tested in separate file C{movies.do.txt}.



The M{\theta} parameter (not M{\nabla}?)
----------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving M{\theta}::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


I{More on M{\theta}.} Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
M{\frac{1}{2}}, M{{1/2}}, M{\pmb{x}}, M{\frac{Du}{dt}},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the C{.tex} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




I{Theorem 5.} Let M{a=1} and M{b=2}. Then M{c=3}.

I{Proof.} Since M{c=a+b}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
M{END}

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
    M{i}        M{h_i}    M{\bar T_i}     C{L_i}    
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  
0                      0          288      -0.0065  
1                 11,000          216          0.0  
2                 20,000          216        0.001  
3                 32,000          228       0.0028  
4                 47,000          270          0.0  
5                 51,000          270      -0.0028  
6                 71,000          214       C{NaN}  
===========  ===========  ===========  ===========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with C{|-} because of a negative number,
and C{|} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  
     exact            C{v_1}      M{a_i} + C{v_2}     C{verb_3_}    
===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  
              9             9.62             5.57             8.98  
            -20           -23.39            -7.65           -19.93  
             10            17.74            -4.50             9.96  
              0            -9.19             4.13            -0.26  
===============  ===============  ===============  ===============  

Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript M{a_i}: C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I{Files C{my_file_v1.py} and C{my_file_v2.py} define some math M{a_{i-1}}.} Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like C{.txt}.


Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with C{Example:}
and then, with the command-line option C{--examples_as_exercises} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


I{a)} State some problem.

I{Solution.} The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

I{b)} State some other problem.

I{Hint 1.} A hint can be given.

I{Hint 2.} Maybe even another hint?

I{Solution.} The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, or
the entire URL if desired, U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.  Here is a
plain file link U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or
U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{a link with
newline<testdoc.do.txt>}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>} or U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}. Also C{file:///} works: U{link to a
file<file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: U{C{hpl@simula.no}<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or just a U{mail link<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or a raw U{mailto:hpl@simula.no<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the C{latex} format:
U{Newton-Cotes<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>} formulas
and a U{good book<http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>}
and U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>} which has a shebang.

For the C{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the C{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}
is used), as in this reference to
U{C{decay_mod}<https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>}, U{C{ball1.py}<http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>},
and U{C{ball2.py}<http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>}.




More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
C{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
U{google<http://google.com>}, U{google<http://google.com>}, and
U{google<http://google.com>}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

                  it causes problems for Epytext.





More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for epytext", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".


Exercises
=========



# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin M{N} times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





Remarks
~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint 1.} Use C{r = random.random()} and define head as C{r <= 0.5}.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint 2.} Draw an integer among M{\{1,2\}} with
C{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when C{r} is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
I{Answer.} If the C{random.random()} function returns a number M{<1/2}, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this M{N} number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
I{Solution.} Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)


# --- end solution of exercise ---
Filenames: C{flip_coin.py}, C{flip_coin.pdf}.

# --- end exercise ---


Not an exercise
---------------

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



# --- begin exercise ---

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval M{[0,1)}?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.} To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw M{N} such random numbers using Python's standard C{random} module,
count how many of them, M{M}, that fall in the interval M{(0.5,0.6)}, and
compute the probability as M{M/N}.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---




# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where M{R} is the radius of the circle, M{(x_0,y_0)} is the
center point, and M{t} is a parameter in the unit interval M{[0,1]}.
For any M{t}, M{(x,y)} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate C{n} points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw M{N} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the C{circle} function
above.


I{a)} Let M{R} be normally distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.} Use the C{numpy.random} module to draw the
M{x_0}, M{y_0}, and M{R} quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
I{Answer.} Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
I{Solution.} Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

I{b)} Let M{R} be uniformly distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} normally distributed.
Filename: C{norm.py}.

I{c)} Let M{R} and M{(x_0,y_0)} be normally distributed.

Filename: C{circles.pdf}.

I{Tip.} 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent U{Script for Introduction to Version Control<http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are U{Dropbox<http://dropbox.com>} and U{Google Drive<http://drive.google.com>}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to U{http://dropbox.com<http://dropbox.com>} and watch the video. It explains
how files, like C{myfile.py}, perhaps containing much math, like
M{\partial u/\partial t}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with C{verbatim inline}
---------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) C{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: C{admon.do.txt}.

The format of this document is
plain

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.


Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line


        Here are two lines that make up
        a block quote.


Here is a reference to Equation (my:eq1).


Subsection 1
------------



More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.



Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::


        def f(x):
            return x+1


Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::


        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::


        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran::


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::


              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML::


        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test verbatim inline font especially with a newline
inside the text and an exclamation mark at the end: BEGIN! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the Verb typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test !bc and !ec as well as !bsummary.
Also test backslashes and braces like \begin, \begin{enumerate},
\end{this}\end{that}, and {something \inside braces} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in a != b,
and a Doconce directive a la !bc.

Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak. 
And one more. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.



Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]




Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like my_file_v1 and my_file_v2 as well as math with subscript as in t_{i+1}. {myfig} 


Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]



*Remark.* Movies are tested in separate file movies.do.txt.



The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)
----------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}


Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}



Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the .tex by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.* Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------



Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

========  ========  ========  ========  
   i        h_i     \bar T_i    L_i     
========  ========  ========  ========  
0                0       288   -0.0065  
1           11,000       216       0.0  
2           20,000       216     0.001  
3           32,000       228    0.0028  
4           47,000       270       0.0  
5           51,000       270   -0.0028  
6           71,000       214       NaN  
========  ========  ========  ========  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with |- because of a negative number,
and | right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=========  =========  =========  =========  
  exact       v_1     a_i + v_2   verb_3_   
=========  =========  =========  =========  
        9       9.62       5.57       8.98  
      -20     -23.39      -7.65     -19.93  
       10      17.74      -4.50       9.96  
        0      -9.19       4.13      -0.26  
=========  =========  =========  =========  

Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: my_file_v1 and my_file_v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Files my_file_v1.py and my_file_v2.py define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like .txt.


Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with Example:
and then, with the command-line option --examples_as_exercises be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or a link with
newline (testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also file:/// works: link to a
file (file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: hpl@simula.no (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a mail link (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the latex format:
Newton-Cotes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a good book (http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the --device=paper option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the --latex_no_program_footnotelink
is used), as in this reference to
decay_mod (https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py), ball1.py (http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py),
and ball2.py (http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py).




More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
--device=paper option must be correct. We have
google (http://google.com), google (http://google.com), and
google (http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}




More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 3: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for plain", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems".


Exercises
=========

----------------------



Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





Remarks
~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
r = random.randint(1,2) and define head when r is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* If the random.random() function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---

        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard random module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---




# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate n points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the circle function
above.


*a)* Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.* Use the numpy.random module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---


# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---


# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)* Let R be uniformly distributed and (x_0,y_0) normally distributed.
Filename: norm.py.

*c)* Let R and (x_0,y_0) be normally distributed.

Filename: circles.pdf.

At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent Script for Introduction to Version Control (http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are Dropbox (http://dropbox.com) and Google Drive (http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like myfile.py, perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with verbatim inline
------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) verbatim code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: admon.do.txt.

The format of this document is
pandoc
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->



## Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

#### Computer code

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then just the subroutine,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and finally the complete file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing other code environments. First Python:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which gets rendered as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then Cython:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
And a little bit of Fortran:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which then is typeset as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTML:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System call:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in `a != b`,
and a Doconce directive a la `!bc`.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. \n
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display \n
this correctly when HTML is the output format. \n
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

#### Running OS commands


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Subsection 2: Testing figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

![Visualization of a wave. ](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

![](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)



<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

![A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. ](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)

<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

Test URL as figure name:

![](https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png)

<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->


*Remark.* Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

### The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*More on $\theta$.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$\frac{1}{2}$, ${1/2}$, $\pmb{x}$, $\frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

$$

\frac{Du}{dt} = 0


$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}

$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

$$

Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
\label{aligneq1}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{equation}
$$


### Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->

*Theorem 5.* Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
*Proof.* Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


### Tables


<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:



    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  



The Doconce source code reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


   $i$        $h_i$     $\bar T_i$    `L_i`     
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  
0                    0         288     -0.0065  
1               11,000         216         0.0  
2               20,000         216       0.001  
3               32,000         228      0.0028  
4               47,000         270         0.0  
5               51,000         270     -0.0028  
6               71,000         214       `NaN`  


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


    exact          `v_1`      $a_i$ + `v_2`    `verb_3_`    
-------------  -------------  -------------  -------------  
            9           9.62           5.57           8.98  
          -20         -23.39          -7.65         -19.93  
           10          17.74          -4.50           9.96  
            0          -9.19           4.13          -0.26  


Finally, a table with math
(`bm` that expands to `boldsymbol`, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->



                                                                                                                                                                                 
---------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------  
                     $\mathcal{L}=0$                       [`080`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0080.png)  [`085`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0085.png)  
                          $a=b$                            [`090`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0090.png)  [`095`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0095.png)  
             $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =0 $               [`100`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0100.png)  [`105`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0105.png)  



### A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`

*Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.* Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like `.txt`.


### Bibliography test

Here is an example: @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, @Langtangen_et_al_2002 gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in @Langtangen_1994a.
The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002;@Mardal_et_al_2003a.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:

### Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)* State some problem.

*Solution.* The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)* State some other problem.

*Hint 1.* A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.* Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.* The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


### URLs

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>.  Here is a
plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>, or
<testdoc.do.txt> or <testdoc.do.txt> or [a link with
newline](testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also `file:///` works: [link to a
file](file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [`hpl@simula.no`](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a [mail link](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw <mailto:hpl@simula.no>.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[Newton-Cotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a [good book](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>
and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae> which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
[`decay_mod`](https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py), [`ball1.py`](http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py),
and [`ball2.py`](http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py).


<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[google](http://google.com), [google](http://google.com), and
[google](http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

## LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$
 a = b + c 
$$
or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$

\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} 

$$

$$
  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v

$$


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} 
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$
Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to the last equation by \eqref{split:envir:eq}.

Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$

Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$
Let us refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2} again, and to the
alignat variant \eqref{eq1a}-\eqref{eq2a}, and to \eqref{my:eq1}.

Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  [Problem 2: Flip a Coin](#n) and  [Project 3: Compute a Probability](#y),
as well as  [Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles](#s) and [Project 9: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for pandoc](#c), and in
between there we have  [Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems](#s).


## Exercises



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Problem 2: Flip a Coin

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





#### Remarks

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 1.* Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.* If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.* Code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->
Filenames: `flip_coin.py`, `flip_coin.pdf`.
<!-- solution files: mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


### Not an exercise

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Project 3: Compute a Probability

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.


*a)* Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

*b)* Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
Filename: `norm.py`.

*c)* Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [Script for Introduction to Version Control](http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

*Summary.*

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


### Appendix: Testing inline comments

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. [hpl 1: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <http://dropbox.com> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  [hpl 3: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.]

### Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline`

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

<p>More text, with a reference back to Section [sec1] and [subsec1], and further to the sections [subsec1] and [subsubsec:ex], which encourages you to do the tasks in the Exercises [demo:ex:1] and [exer:some:formula]. Appendices [app1] and [app2] are also nice elements.</p>
<h4 id="computer-code.">Computer code.</h4>
<p>Let’s do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,</p>
<pre><code>subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return</code></pre>
<p>and then just the subroutine,</p>
<pre><code>      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return</code></pre>
<p>and finally the complete file:</p>
<pre><code>C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return</code></pre>
<p>Testing other code environments. First Python:</p>
<pre><code>!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec</code></pre>
<p>which gets rendered as</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
    return x+1</code></pre>
<p>Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:</p>
<pre><code>class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&amp;mode=display&amp;cumulative=false&amp;heapPrimitives=false&amp;drawParentPointers=false&amp;textReferences=false&amp;py=2&amp;curInstr=0}">Visualize execution</a>)</p>
<p>Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but such cells are not supported by this format).</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
b = 3
print &#39;a+b:&#39;, a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel(&#39;x&#39;); ylabel(&#39;y&#39;)
show()</code></pre>
<p>Then Cython:</p>
<pre><code>cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1</code></pre>
<p>C++:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
   std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sample output&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   return 0
}</code></pre>
<p>And a little bit of Fortran:</p>
<pre><code>!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec</code></pre>
<p>which then is typeset as</p>
<pre><code>subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end</code></pre>
<p>HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Column 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Column 2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.67526 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.92871 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- comment --&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<p>System call:</p>
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; mkdir test
Terminal&gt; cd test
Terminal&gt; myprog -f
output1
output2</code></pre>
<p>It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now be fixed: test  !bc  and  !ec  as well as  !bsummary . Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>, <code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in  a != b , and a Doconce directive a la  !bc .</p>
<p>Here is some color and an attempt to write Some formats will only display<br />this correctly when HTML is the output format.<br />But here some more running text is added which is not part of the previous blocks with line breaks.</p>

<p>Here is some text.</p>
<p>Let us also add a test of quotes such as “double quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)”; written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats. Here is another sentence that “caused” a bug in the past because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.</p>
<h2 id="bibliography-test">Bibliography test</h2>
<p>Here is an example: @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 discussed propagation of large destructive water waves, @Langtangen_et_al_2002 gave an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing random vibrations was investigated in @Langtangen_1994a. The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package. Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 [@Mardal_et_al_2003a].</p>
<p>We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting problem with blanks in the keys in reST format: @Langtangen_1992c [@Langtangen_1994a; @Mortensen_et_al_2011; @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002] and @Langtangen_et_al_2002 [@Glimsdal_et_al_20006; @Rahman_et_al_2006b; @Haga_et_al_2011a; @Langtangen_2003a; @Langtangen_2008a; @Langtangen:95] and all the work of @Langtangen_2012 [@Mardal_et_al_2003a; @Jeberg_et_al_2004] as well as old work @Langtangen_1988d and @Langtangen_1989e, and the talk @Langtangen_talk_2007a. Langtangen also had two thesis @Langtangen:85 [@Langtangen_1989e]. More retro citations are the old ME-IN323 book @Langtangen:91 and the @Langtangen:94b OONSKI ’94 paper.</p>

<p>The answer to this other subproblem goes here, maybe over multiple doconce input lines.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>[subsubsec:ex]</p>
<p>Testing of URLs: hpl’s home page <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a>, or the entire URL if desired, <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}"></a>. Here is a plain file link <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a>, or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a>, or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a> or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}"></a> or <a href="{testdoc.do.txt}">a link with newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word too: <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a> or <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}">link to a file</a> is fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just the plain URL as in <a href="{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}"></a>, if followed by space, comma, colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period (which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).</p>
<p>Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}"></a>, or just a <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="{mailto:hpl@simula.no}"></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format: <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonCotes_formulas}">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas and a <a href="{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+scienceengineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}">good book</a>. Need to test Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too: <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewtonCotes_formulas}"></a> and <a href="{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}"></a> which has a shebang.</p>
<p>For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code> is used), as in this reference to <a href="{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}"></a>, <a href="{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}"></a>, and <a href="{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}"></a>.</p>
<p>More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the <code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, and <a href="{http://google.com}">google</a>, which should result in exactly three footnotes.</p>
<h2 id="test-of-some-latex-fixes">Test of Some LaTeX Fixes</h2>
<p>Let’s check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e. expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen, or maybe also prof. Ting, will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. [subsubsec:ex] or Ch. [subsubsec:ex], or even App. [subsubsec:ex], must also be handled. Likewise, this is test no. <span class="math">\(i\)</span> of Doconce features. A sentence containing &quot;refines lines&quot; could easily fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything. Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. [mytab].</p>
<h1 id="latex-mathematics">LaTeX Mathematics</h1>
<p>Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment: <span class="math">\[a = b + c\]</span> or with number and label, as in ([my:eq1]), using the equation environment:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to this equation by ([my:eq1]).</p>
<p>Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\pmb{a} &amp;= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

a &amp;= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to ([eq1])-([eq2]). They are a bit simpler than the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>. Also test <span class="math">\(a_{i-j}\)</span> as well as <span class="math">\(kx-wt\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats. Testing multiline:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gathered}

\begin{split}
a = b = q &amp;+ \\ 
  &amp; f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}\]</span></p>
<p>We can refer to the last equation by ([split:envir:eq]).</p>
<p>Testing gather:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gathered}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9\end{gathered}\]</span></p>
<p>Testing alignat:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}

a &amp;= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad &amp; \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &amp;= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x &amp; x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Let us refer to ([eq1])-([eq2]) again, and to the alignat variant ([eq1a])-([eq2a]), and to ([my:eq1]).</p>
<p>Testing eqnarray:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<h2 id="project-compute-a-probability" class="unnumbered">Project : Compute a Probability</h2>
<p>[demo:ex:2]</p>
<p>What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval <span class="math">\([0,1)\)</span>?</p>
<p>At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX in previous Doconce versions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>item1</p></li>
<li><p>item2</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hint.">Hint.</h4>
<p>To answer this question empirically, let a program draw <span class="math">\(N\)</span> such random numbers using Python’s standard <code>random</code> module, count how many of them, <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, that fall in the interval <span class="math">\((0.5,0.6)\)</span>, and compute the probability as <span class="math">\(M/N\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="project-explore-distributions-of-random-circles" class="unnumbered">Project : Explore Distributions of Random Circles</h2>
<p>[proj:circle1]</p>
<p>The formula for a circle is given by</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
x &amp;= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &amp;= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is the radius of the circle, <span class="math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> is the center point, and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a parameter in the unit interval <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span>. For any <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a point on the circle. The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)</code></pre>
<p>The goal of this project is to draw <span class="math">\(N\)</span> circles with random center and radius. Plot each circle using the <code>circle</code> function above.</p>

<p>[Tip.] Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.</p>
<p>Need a lot of text to surround the summary box. Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and share files among several computers and collaborators in a professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working with programs or technical reports it is essential to have changes documented and to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have the latest updates of the files. Greg Wilson’ excellent <a href="{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly from using version control systems.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site. I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other important files.</p>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="{http://dropbox.com}">Dropbox</a> and <a href="{http://drive.google.com}">Google Drive</a>. It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is challenging to find the right version from the past when there are so many of them.</p>
<p>More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control systems. The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</p>
<p>The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these files. Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and synchronize the files with the &quot;master version&quot; at the site where the project is hosted. If you at some point need to go back to a version of the files at some particular point in the past, this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see what various people have done with the files in the various versions.</p>
<p>All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps. The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings when you use version control systems every day. The point now is to get started.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site. <strong>hpl 1</strong>: * not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. * I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other important files.</p>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. <strong>mp 2</strong>: * Simply go to <a href="{http://dropbox.com}"></a> and watch the video. It explains how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like <span class="math">\(\partial u/\partial t\)</span>, are easily communicated between machines. * It is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share files among laptops and mobile units.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-testing-headings-ending-with-verbatim-inline">Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code></h2>
<p>The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2) ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special case in LaTeX.</p>
<p>And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.</p>

<p>It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>. Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>, <code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>, and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.</p>
<p>Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with green color containing a linebreak. And one more.</font> Some formats will only display this correctly when HTML is the output format.

<h3 id="custom-environments">Custom Environments</h3>
<p>Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako (for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems. Should look nice in most formats!</p>
<!-- begin theorem -->

<p><em>Theorem 5.</em> Let <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b=2\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(c=3\)</span>. <!-- end theorem --></p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<p><em>Proof.</em> Since <span class="math">\(c=a+b\)</span>, the result follows from straightforward addition. <span class="math">\(\Diamond\)</span> <!-- end proof --></p>
<p>As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest achievement.</p>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>Let us take this table from the manual:</p>

<p><em>Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math <span class="math">\(a_{i-1}\)</span>.</em> Here is some text.</p>
<p>Let us also add a test of quotes such as &quot;double quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)&quot;; written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats. Here is another sentence that &quot;caused&quot; a bug in the past because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.</p>
<h3 id="bibliography-test">Bibliography test</h3>
<p>Here is an example: @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 discussed propagation of large destructive water waves, @Langtangen_et_al_2002 gave an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing random vibrations was investigated in @Langtangen_1994a. The book chapter @Mardal_et_al_2003a contains information on C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro reference is @Langtangen_1988d about a big FORTRAN package. Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see @Langtangen_Pedersen_2002;@Mardal_et_al_2003a.</p>
<p>We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting problem with blanks in the keys in reST format: @Langtangen_1992c;@Langtangen_1994a;@Mortensen_et_al_2011;@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002 and @Langtangen_et_al_2002;@Glimsdal_et_al_20006;@Rahman_et_al_2006b;@Haga_et_al_2011a;@Langtangen_2003a;@Langtangen_2008a;@Langtangen:95 and all the work of @Langtangen_2012;@Mardal_et_al_2003a;@Jeberg_et_al_2004 as well as old work @Langtangen_1988d and @Langtangen_1989e, and the talk @Langtangen_talk_2007a. Langtangen also had two thesis @Langtangen:85;@Langtangen_1989e. More retro citations are the old ME-IN323 book @Langtangen:91 and the @Langtangen:94b OONSKI '94 paper.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-examples-can-be-typeset-as-exercises">Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises</h3>
<p>Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code> and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution environments as part of the example.</p>

Here is a plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt> or <testdoc.do.txt> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt">a link with newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html">link to a file</a> is fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">http://folk.uio.no/hpl</a>, if followed by space, comma, colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period (which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).</p>

<p>For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code> is used), as in this reference to <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py"><code>decay_mod</code></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py"><code>ball1.py</code></a>, and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py"><code>ball2.py</code></a>.</p>

<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. -->

<p>More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the <code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct.

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


<p>What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval <span class="math">\([0,1)\)</span>?</p>
<p>At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX in previous Doconce versions:</p>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p><em>Hint.</em> To answer this question empirically, let a program draw <span class="math">\(N\)</span> such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module, count how many of them, <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, that fall in the interval <span class="math">\((0.5,0.6)\)</span>, and compute the probability as <span class="math">\(M/N\)</span>.</p>

For any <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a point on the circle. The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:</p>

<p><em>Tip.</em> Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.</p>
<p>Need a lot of text to surround the summary box. Version control systems allow you to record the history of files and share files among several computers and collaborators in a professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working with programs or technical reports it is essential to have changes documented and to ensure that every computer and person involved in the project have the latest updates of the files. Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly from using version control systems.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site. I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and scientific writing work - and all other important files.</p>
<p>The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is challenging to find the right version from the past when there are so many of them.</p>
<p>More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control systems. The following text aims at providing you with the minimum information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</p>
<p>The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these files. Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and synchronize the files with the &quot;master version&quot; at the site where the project is hosted. If you at some point need to go back to a version of the files at some particular point in the past, this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see what various people have done with the files in the various versions.</p>
<p>All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps. The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings when you use version control systems every day. The point now is to get started.</p>

<p>Projects that you want to share among several computers or project workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site &quot;in the cloud&quot; and updated through communication with that site.

<p>The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com">http://dropbox.com</a> and watch the video. It explains how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like <span class="math">\(\partial u/\partial t\)</span>, are easily communicated between machines.] It is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share files among laptops and mobile units.</p>

************** File: html_template.do.txt *****************
DATE: today

===== This is a test of HTML templates =====

Note: When using HTML templates, the Doconce file cannot have a title
(to avoid generating a header). It should neither have an author.

======= This is a 7 heading =======

Here is some code:
!bc pycod
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
!ec

===== This is a 5 heading =====

The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: *title*, *date* and *main*,
where *main* will become the Doconce file (the main body of text),
*title* is the first heading in the Doconce file, and
*date* is extracted from the Doconce file (if present).

<!-- main body -->


<!-- tocinfo
{'highest level': 1,

              (' This is a 7 heading ', 1, None, '___sec1'),

<!-- ------------------- main content ---------------------- -->

<h3>This is a test of HTML templates  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>

<p>
Note: When using HTML templates, the Doconce file cannot have a title
(to avoid generating a header). It should neither have an author.

<h2>This is a 7 heading  <a name="___sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is some code:
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h3>This is a 5 heading  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: <em>title</em>, <em>date</em> and <em>main</em>,
where <em>main</em> will become the Doconce file (the main body of text),
<em>title</em> is the first heading in the Doconce file, and
<em>date</em> is extracted from the Doconce file (if present).

<h1>Generalized References <a name="genrefs"></a></h1>

<p>
Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, Doconce offers <em>generalized references</em> which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the <code>xr</code> package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the <code>xr</code> feature in LaTeX.

<p>
The syntax of generalized references reads
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">ref[internal][cite][external]
</pre></div>
<p>
If all <code>ref{label}</code> references in the text <code>internal</code> are references
to labels in the present document, the above <code>ref</code> command is replaced
by the text <code>internal</code>. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out <code>internal cite</code> since the <code>internal</code> reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the <code>internal</code> syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another LaTeX document, the output is just <code>cite</code>.
For all
output formats other than <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>, the <code>external</code>
text will be the output.

<p>
Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in &quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot; in
the document &quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
With <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> as output, this translates to
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex}, Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
if the label <code>{subsec:ex}</code> appears in the present Doconce source, and
otherwise
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex} in &quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
In a format different from <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>, the effective Doconce
text becomes
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot; in
the document &quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
The rendered text in the current format <code>html</code> becomes

<p>
<blockquote>
    As explained in
    a <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" target="_self">section</a> in
    the document <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html" target="_self">A Document for Testing Doconce</a>
    <a href="#testdoc:12">[1]</a>, Doconce documents may include tables.
</blockquote>


<p>
A reference to an entire external document, which is usually a chapter
if the reference is internal in the Doconce source, applies the
<code>refch</code> syntax:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}][&quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
&quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
The output now if <code>ch:testdoc</code> is not a label in the document,
becomes in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> case

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
&quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
That is, the internal reference <code>Chapter ...</code> is omitted since
it is not meaningful to refer to an external document as "Chapter".
The resulting rendered text in the current format <code>html</code> becomes

<p>
<blockquote>
    As explained in
    the document
    <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html" target="_self">A Document for Testing Doconce</a>
    <a href="#testdoc:12">[1]</a>, Doconce documents may include tables.
</blockquote>


<p>
Note that LaTeX cannot
have links to local files, so a complete URL on the form
<code>http://...</code> must be used.

<p>
And here is another example with internal references only:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].
</pre></div>
<p>
The text is rendered to

<p>
<blockquote>
    Generalized references are described in
    The section <a href="#genrefs">Generalized References</a>.
</blockquote>

\chapter{Generalized References}
\label{genrefs}

Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, Doconce offers \emph{generalized references} which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since {\LaTeX} supports
references to labels in external documents via the \code{xr} package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the \code{xr} feature in {\LaTeX}.

The syntax of generalized references reads
\bccq
ref[internal][cite][external]
\eccq
If all \code{ref{label}} references in the text \code{internal} are references
to labels in the present document, the above \code{ref} command is replaced
by the text \code{internal}. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is \code{latex} or \code{pdflatex} one assumes that the references in \code{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line \code{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is \code{internal cite} and the
{\LaTeX} package \code{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out \code{internal cite} since the \code{internal} reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the \code{internal} syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another {\LaTeX} document, the output is just \code{cite}.
For all
output formats other than \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex}, the \code{external}
text will be the output.

Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:
\bccq
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing Doconce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
With \code{latex} or \code{pdflatex} as output, this translates to
\bccq
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
if the label \code{{subsec:ex}} appears in the present Doconce source, and
otherwise
\bccq
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex} in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
In a format different from \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex}, the effective Doconce
text becomes
\bccq
As explained in
a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing Doconce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
The rendered text in the current format \code{latex} becomes


\begin{quote}
As explained in
Section~\ref{subsec:ex}in \href{{http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex}}{Langtangen, 2012}
\cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\end{quote}


A reference to an entire external document, which is usually a chapter
if the reference is internal in the Doconce source, applies the
\code{refch} syntax:

\bccq
As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}]["Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
The output now if \code{ch:testdoc} is not a label in the document,
becomes in the \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} case

\bccq
As explained in
"Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\eccq
That is, the internal reference \code{Chapter ...} is omitted since
it is not meaningful to refer to an external document as "Chapter".
The resulting rendered text in the current format \code{latex} becomes


\begin{quote}
As explained in
\href{{http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html}}{Langtangen, 2012}
\cite{testdoc:12}, Doconce documents may include tables.
\end{quote}


Note that {\LaTeX} cannot
have links to local files, so a complete URL on the form
\code{http://...} must be used.

And here is another example with internal references only:

\bccq
Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].
\eccq
The text is rendered to


\begin{quote}
Generalized references are described in

For this purpose, Doconce offers *generalized references* which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the ``xr`` package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the ``xr`` feature in LaTeX.

The syntax of generalized references reads

.. code-block:: text


        ref[internal][cite][external]

If all `:ref:`label`` references in the text ``internal`` are references
to labels in the present document, the above ``ref`` command is replaced
by the text ``internal``. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is ``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out ``internal cite`` since the ``internal`` reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the ``internal`` syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another LaTeX document, the output is just ``cite``.
For all
output formats other than ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``, the ``external``
text will be the output.

in a document:

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>,
and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of a wave. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>
</center>

<p>
<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<p>
Test URL as figure name:

<center><p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png" align="bottom" width=500,></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "emacs" -->
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td><div class="linenodiv" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding-right: 10px"><pre style="line-height: 125%">1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\tag{1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "emacs" -->
<blockquote>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td><div class="linenodiv" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding-right: 10px"><pre style="line-height: 125%">1

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     \( i \)      </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    \( h_i \)     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  \( \bar T_i \)  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <code>L_i</code> </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0                   </td> <td align="right">   0                   </td> <td align="right">   288                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0065             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1                   </td> <td align="right">   11,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   3                   </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                   </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                   </td> <td align="right">   51,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028             </td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            exact             </b></td> <td align="center"><b>       <code>v_1</code>       </b></td> <td align="center"><b> \( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>     <code>verb_3_</code>     </b></td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
Finally, a table with math
(<code>bm</code> that expands to <code>boldsymbol</code>, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<p>
<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->

<h3>A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript \( a_i \): <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code>  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
<b>Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math \( a_{i-1} \).</b>
Here is
some text.

<p>
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.

<h3>Bibliography test  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an example: <a href="._testdoc002.html#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, <a href="._testdoc002.html#Langtangen_et_al_2002">[2]</a> gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in <a href="._testdoc002.html#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a>.
The book chapter <a href="._testdoc002.html#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a> contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is <a href="._testdoc002.html#Langtangen_1988d">[5]</a> about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see

<p>
We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:

<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_self"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h2>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec12"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\tag{6}
\end{multline}
$$

Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{7}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to the last equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-7">(7)</a>.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$


<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \tag{8} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \tag{9}
\end{alignat}
$$

Let us refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a> again, and to the
alignat variant <a href="#mjx-eqn-8">(8)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-9">(9)</a>, and to <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \tag{10}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \tag{11}
\end{eqnarray}
$$


<p>
More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

<p>
Below, we have <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#demo:ex:2">Project 3: Compute a Probability</a>,
as well as <a href="#proj:circle1">Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles</a> and <a href="#exer:you">Project 9: References in a headings do not work well in html</a>, and in

<h3>Problem 2: Flip a Coin <a name="demo:ex:1"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/exercise1.svg" width=100 align="right">

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<p>
<!-- Torture tests -->

<p>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin \( N \) times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec15"></a></h4>

<p>
Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Draw an integer among \( \{1,2\} \) with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
<b>Answer.</b>
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number \( <1/2 \), let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this \( N \) number of times.

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<h3>Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/exercise1.svg" width=100 align="right">


<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.
</div>


<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
\( \partial u/\partial t \), are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.

<!-- end inline comment -->

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec37"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<h2>Section 1 <a name="sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here is a reference to Equation <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h3>Subsection 1 <a name="subsec1"></a></h3>

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
The section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#exer:some:formula">Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
The appendices <a href="#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h4>Computer code  <a name="___sec2"></a></h4>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

and then just the subroutine,
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>

<p>
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">a <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2</span>

</pre></div>
<p>
Then Cython:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">cpdef</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(double x):

</pre></div>
<p>

C++:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #BC7A00">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #B00040">int</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">main</span>()

   <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> <span style="color: #666666">0</span>
}
</pre></div>
<p>

And a little bit of Fortran:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which then is typeset as

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return

</pre></div>
<p>
HTML:

<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>,
and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> 
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of a wave. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/test/../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/test/../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> 
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in $latex t_{i+1}$. <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/test/../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>

<p>
<center><p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png" align="bottom" width=500,></p></center>

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<h3>The $latex \theta$ parameter (not $latex \nabla$?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $latex \theta$:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on $latex \theta$.</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$latex \frac{1}{2}$, $latex {1/2}$, $latex \pmb{x}$, $latex \frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
 $



<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

 $

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>

<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let $latex a=1$ and $latex b=2$. Then $latex c=3$.


<p>

<b>Proof.</b>
Since $latex c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$latex latex \Diamond$


<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>


<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<h3>A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $latex a_i$: <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code>  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
<b>Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math $latex a_{i-1}$.</b>
Here is
some text.

<p>
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.

<h3>Bibliography test  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an example: <a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, <a href="#Langtangen_et_al_2002">[2]</a> gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in <a href="#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a>.
The book chapter <a href="#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a> contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is <a href="#Langtangen_1988d">[5]</a> about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
<a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> <a href="#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a>.

<p>
We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
<a href="#Langtangen_1992c">[6]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a> <a href="#Mortensen_et_al_2011">[7]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a>

Langtangen also had two thesis <a href="#Langtangen:85">[18]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_1989e">[16]</a>.
More retro citations are

<a href="#Langtangen:94b">[20]</a> OONSKI '94 paper.

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_blank">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_blank">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_blank"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_blank"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_blank"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_blank"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h2>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec12"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

$latex  a = b + c  $


or with number and label, as in <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>, using the equation environment:

$latex 
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
 $


We can refer to this equation by <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

$latex 
\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n}  $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
 $



<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

$latex 
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6   $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
 $


We can refer to <b>(REF to equation eq1 not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2 not supported)</b>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test $latex a_{i-j}$ as well as $latex kx-wt$.

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u

\end{multline}

Testing split:

$latex 

\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
 $


We can refer to the last equation by <b>(REF to equation split:envir:eq not supported)</b>.

<p>
Testing gather:

\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}


<p>
Testing alignat:

\begin{alignat}{2}
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad  \mbox{for } q\geq 0   $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x  x\in\Omega 
\end{alignat}

Let us refer to <b>(REF to equation eq1 not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2 not supported)</b> again, and to the
alignat variant <b>(REF to equation eq1a not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2a not supported)</b>, and to <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:

\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
\end{eqnarray}


<p>
More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

<h3>Problem 2: Flip a Coin <a name="demo:ex:1"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/question_blue_on_white1.png" width=80 align="right">



<p>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $latex N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec15"></a></h4>

<p>
Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

<p>

<ol>
<li> Mark 1.</li>
<li> Mark 2.</li>
</ol>



<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Draw an integer among $latex \{1,2\}$ with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<p>

<b>Answer.</b>
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number $latex <1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $latex N$ number of times.

<h3>Project 3: Compute a Probability <a name="demo:ex:2"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/question_blue_on_white1.png" width=80 align="right">


<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $latex [0,1)$?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2</li>
</ol>



<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $latex N$ such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, $latex M$, that fall in the interval $latex (0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $latex M/N$.

<h3>Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a></h3>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/question_blue_on_white1.png" width=80 align="right">


<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>

$latex 
x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t, $

$latex  
y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
 $


where $latex R$ is the radius of the circle, $latex (x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $latex t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $latex [0,1]$.
For any $latex t$, $latex (x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_blank">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 

<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>

 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 

<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
$latex \partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>

 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

<p>
When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.

and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</em>]</font>

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec37"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

<!-- !split -->

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<!-- Just a comment -->

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h2>Section 1 <a name="sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here is a reference to Equation \eqref{my:eq1}.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h3>Subsection 1 <a name="subsec1"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
The section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#exer:some:formula">Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
The appendices <a href="#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h4>Computer code  <a name="___sec2"></a></h4>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>

<!-- code=fortran (from !bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->

and then just the subroutine,

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span><span style="color: #19177C">test</span>()

Testing other code environments. First Python:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which gets rendered as

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pyscpro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>,
and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of a wave. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>
</center>

<p>
<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<p>
Test URL as figure name:

<p>
<center><p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png" align="bottom" width=500,></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     \( i \)      </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    \( h_i \)     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  \( \bar T_i \)  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <code>L_i</code> </b></td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   1                   </td> <td align="right">   11,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2                   </td> <td align="right">   20,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.001               </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3                   </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                   </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                   </td> <td align="right">   51,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   6                   </td> <td align="right">   71,000              </td> <td align="right">   214                 </td> <td align="right">   <code>NaN</code>    </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            exact             </b></td> <td align="center"><b>       <code>v_1</code>       </b></td> <td align="center"><b> \( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>     <code>verb_3_</code>     </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   9                               </td> <td align="right">   9.62                            </td> <td align="right">   5.57                            </td> <td align="right">   8.98                            </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   -20                             </td> <td align="right">   -23.39                          </td> <td align="right">   -7.65                           </td> <td align="right">   -19.93                          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   10                              </td> <td align="right">   17.74                           </td> <td align="right">   -4.50                           </td> <td align="right">   9.96                            </td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
Finally, a table with math
(<code>bm</code> that expands to <code>boldsymbol</code>, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<p>
<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->

<h3>A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript \( a_i \): <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code>  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
<b>Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math \( a_{i-1} \).</b>
Here is
some text.

<p>
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.

<h3>Bibliography test  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an example: <a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, <a href="#Langtangen_et_al_2002">[2]</a> gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in <a href="#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a>.
The book chapter <a href="#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a> contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is <a href="#Langtangen_1988d">[5]</a> about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
<a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> <a href="#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a>.

<p>
We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
<a href="#Langtangen_1992c">[6]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a> <a href="#Mortensen_et_al_2011">[7]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a>
and

and all the work of
<a href="#Langtangen_2012">[14]</a> <a href="#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a> <a href="#Jeberg_et_al_2004">[15]</a> as well as

Langtangen also had two thesis <a href="#Langtangen:85">[18]</a> <a href="#Langtangen_1989e">[16]</a>.
More retro citations are

<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_self"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<h2>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec12"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$

Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to the last equation by \eqref{split:envir:eq}.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$


<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$

Let us refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2} again, and to the
alignat variant \eqref{eq1a}-\eqref{eq2a}, and to \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing inline comments  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 
<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>mp 2</b>: <em>Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
\( \partial u/\partial t \), are easily communicated between machines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->
 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec37"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade {\LaTeX} (from Doconce).

% Just a comment

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}



\subsection{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file:
\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

System call:
\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

It is time to test \code{verbatim inline font} especially with \code{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \code{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the \code{Verb} typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test \code{!bc} and \code{!ec} as well as \code{!bsummary}.
Also test backslashes and braces like \code{\begin}, \code{\begin{enumerate}},
\code{\end{this}\end{that}}, and \code{{something \inside braces}} in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in {\LaTeX} inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in \code{a != b},
and a Doconce directive a la \code{!bc}.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red} color and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. \\
And one more.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when HTML is the output format. \\
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

\paragraph{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?).}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\paragraph{Custom Environments.}
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \code{.tex} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\paragraph{Tables.}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\bccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{L\_i} } \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1          & 11,000     & 216        & 0.0        \\
2          & 20,000     & 216        & 0.001      \\

6          & 71,000     & 214        & \code{NaN} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \code{|-} because of a negative number,
and \code{|} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{v\_1} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \code{v\_2} } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \code{verb\_3\_} } \\
\hline
9                  & 9.62               & 5.57               & 8.98               \\
-20                & -23.39             & -7.65              & -19.93             \\
10                 & 17.74              & -4.50              & 9.96               \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Finally, a table with math

\paragraph{Files \protect\code{my\_file\_v1.py} and \protect\code{my\_file\_v2.py} define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)'';
written in the standard {\LaTeX}-style that gives correct
{\LaTeX} formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-{\LaTeX} formats.
Here is another sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like \code{.txt}.


\paragraph{Bibliography test.}
Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with \code{Example:}

typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

\end{doconceexercise}
% --- end exercise ---


\paragraph{URLs.}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \code{file:///} works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \code{latex} format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \code{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the \code{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \code{_static*} folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\code{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\paragraph{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes.}
Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of Doconce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \code{CG-2}.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

To answer this question empirically, let a program

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \code{n} points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \code{circle} function
above.

\clearpage

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\paragraph{Appendix: Testing inline comments.}

\paragraph{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\code{verbatim inline}.}
The point here is to test 1) \code{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \code{admon.do.txt}.

TITLE: How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
AUTHOR: HPL
DATE: today


This document is translated to the format _${FORMAT}_. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

__Test 1: Inline math.__ Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

__Test 2: A single equation without label.__ Here it is

!bt
\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]
!et

__Test 3: A single equation with label.__ Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
and as a three-line latex code:

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
This equation has label (ref{eq1b}).


__Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.__ Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et

__Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.__ We use align with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2b})-(ref{eq3b}).

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but Doconce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is

!bc rst
.. math::
   :label: eq2b

        u(t)=e^{-at}


.. math::
   :label: eq3b

        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}

!ec
# #endif

# #if FORMAT == "pandoc"
Original Pandoc-extended Markdown transformed to HTML via Pandoc
does not work with labels and multiple equations. `doconce md2html`
fixes the trouble by adding full support for MathJax and avoiding
that eqref references become empty.

One can write with align and labels in the Doconce document and get excellent
output in LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Markdown-based HTML. Without
`doconce md2html` one must accept that labeles have very limited support
compared to more advanced MathJax.
# #endif


__Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.__ Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

__Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.__ We use eqnarray with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2c})-(ref{eq3c})?
# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
No, unfortunately not.
Note: Doconce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code

!bc rst
.. math::

        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\
        v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
!ec
That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.
# #endif

__Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.__
We have

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using `\bm`:

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx", "pandoc", "ipynb")
Note: for the ${FORMAT} format, `\bm` was substituted by Doconce
to `\boldsymbol`.
# #endif

This document is translated to the format <b>html</b>. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

<p>
<b>Test 1: Inline math.</b>
Here is a sentence contains the equation \( u(t)=e^{-at} \).

<p>
<b>Test 2: A single equation without label.</b>
Here it is

<p>
$$ u(t)=e^{-at} $$


<p>
<b>Test 3: A single equation with label.</b>
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
looking like

<p>
$$
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
$$

and as a three-line latex code:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
looking like

<p>
$$
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
$$

This equation has label \eqref{eq1b}.

<p>
<b>Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.</b>
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&amp;=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
and results in

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
<b>Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.</b>
We use align with
labels:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&amp;=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
and results in

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2b}-\eqref{eq3b}.

<p>
<b>Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.</b>
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
and results in

<p>
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$


<p>
<b>Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.</b>
We use eqnarray with
labels:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&amp;=&amp; e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
</pre></div>
<p>
and results in

<p>
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Can we refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2c}-\eqref{eq3c}?

<p>
<b>Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.</b>
We have

<p>
$$ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,$$

and \( \nabla\u (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n} \)
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using <code>\bm</code>:

<p>
$$ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,$$

and \( \nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm \).

<p>
Note: for the html format, <code>\bm</code> was substituted by Doconce
to <code>\boldsymbol</code>.

This document is translated to the format \textbf{pdflatex}. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

\paragraph{Test 1: Inline math.}
Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

\paragraph{Test 2: A single equation without label.}
Here it is

\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]

\paragraph{Test 3: A single equation with label.}
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
and as a three-line latex code:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
This equation has label (\ref{eq1b}).


\paragraph{Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.}
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than {\LaTeX} for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.}
We use align with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{align}
We can refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2b})-(\ref{eq3b}).




\paragraph{Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.}
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.}
We use eqnarray with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2c})-(\ref{eq3c})?

\paragraph{Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.}
We have

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using \code{\bm}:

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Author: HPL
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

This document is translated to the format **sphinx**. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

**Test 1: Inline math.**
Here is a sentence contains the equation :math:`u(t)=e^{-at}`.

**Test 2: A single equation without label.**
Here it is


.. math::
         u(t)=e^{-at} 


**Test 3: A single equation with label.**
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
        !et

looking like


.. math::
   :label: eq1
         u(t)=e^{-at} 

and as a three-line latex code:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{equation}
        u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
        \end{equation}
        !et

looking like


.. math::
   :label: eq1b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        

This equation has label :eq:`eq1b`.


**Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.**
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{align*}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        


**Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.**
We use align with
labels:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}
        label{eq2b}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3b}
        \end{align}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
   :label: eq2b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        



.. math::
   :label: eq3b
          
        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt} 
        

We can refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2b`-:eq:`eq3b`.

Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but Doconce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is


.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
           :label: eq2b
        
                u(t)=e^{-at}
        
        
        .. math::
           :label: eq3b
        
                v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}
        




**Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.**
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{eqnarray*}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
        


**Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.**
We use eqnarray with
labels:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}
        label{eq2c}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3c}
        \end{eqnarray}
        !et

and results in


.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt} 
        

Can we refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2c`-:eq:`eq3c`?
No, unfortunately not.
Note: Doconce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code


.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
        
                u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
                v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}

That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.

**Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.**
We have


.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = \nu\nabla^2\pmb{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\pmb{u} (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n}`
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using ``\bm``:


.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = \nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\boldsymbol{u} (\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\boldsymbol{n}`.

Note: for the sphinx format, ``\bm`` was substituted by Doconce
to ``\boldsymbol``.

<!-- !split -->

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from Doconce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h2>Section 1 <a name="sec1"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.

<p>
Here is a reference to Equation <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h3>Subsection 1 <a name="subsec1"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
The section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#exer:some:formula">Exercise 8: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
The appendices <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):

<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the <code>Verb</code> typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>!bsummary</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code> in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in <code>a != b</code>,
and a Doconce directive a la <code>!bc</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. <br />
And one more.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <br />
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h4>Running OS commands  <a name="___sec3"></a></h4>

<h3>Subsection 2: Testing figures <a name="subsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of a wave. <a name="fig:impact"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <a name="myfig"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>
</center>

<p>
<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<p>
Test URL as figure name:

<p>
<center><p><img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png" align="bottom" width=500,></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h3>The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?) <a name="decay:sec:theta"></a></h3>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\tag{1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Doconce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (from !bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     time     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>   velocity   </b></td> <td align="center"><b> acceleration </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.4186          </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.376512        </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0             </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>     \( i \)      </b></td> <td align="center"><b>    \( h_i \)     </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  \( \bar T_i \)  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> <code>L_i</code> </b></td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   1                   </td> <td align="right">   11,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2                   </td> <td align="right">   20,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                 </td> <td align="right">   0.001               </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3                   </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                   </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                   </td> <td align="right">   51,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                 </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   6                   </td> <td align="right">   71,000              </td> <td align="right">   214                 </td> <td align="right">   <code>NaN</code>    </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            exact             </b></td> <td align="center"><b>       <code>v_1</code>       </b></td> <td align="center"><b> \( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code> </b></td> <td align="center"><b>     <code>verb_3_</code>     </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   9                               </td> <td align="right">   9.62                            </td> <td align="right">   5.57                            </td> <td align="right">   8.98                            </td> </tr>

<p>
Finally, a table with math
(<code>bm</code> that expands to <code>boldsymbol</code>, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<h3>A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript \( a_i \): <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code>  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
<b>Files <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math \( a_{i-1} \).</b>
Here is
some text.

<p>
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like <code>.txt</code>.

<h3>Bibliography test  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is an example: <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Langtangen_et_al_2002">[2]</a> gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Langtangen_1994a">[3]</a>.
The book chapter <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Mardal_et_al_2003a">[4]</a> contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro

<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

<h3>Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises <a name="Example"></a></h3>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h3>URLs <a name="subsubsec:ex"></a></h3>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_self"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Problem 2: Flip a Coin <a name="demo:ex:1"></a></h3>
<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<p>
<!-- Torture tests -->

<p>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin \( N \) times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec15"></a></h4>

<p>
Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

<p>

<ol>
<li> Mark 1.</li>
<li> Mark 2.</li>
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>

<h3>Project 3: Compute a Probability <a name="demo:ex:2"></a></h3>

<p>
<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>

in previous Doconce versions:

</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<h3>Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a></h3>

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h3>Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code>  <a name="___sec37"></a></h3>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

A Document for Testing Doconce
==============================

:Date: Jan 32, 2100


************** File: ._testdoc001.rst *****************
.. !split





The format of this document is
sphinx

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. is mutually exclusive in LaTeX


.. _sec1:


Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line



..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.



Here is a reference to Equation :ref:`(3.1) <Eq:my:eq1>`.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.


.. _subsec1:

Subsection 1
------------


.. index:: somefunc function


.. Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line

.. and other special fix situations for HTML.


More text, with a reference back to
the section :ref:`sec1` and :ref:`subsec1`, and further to the
the sections :ref:`subsec1` and :ref:`subsubsec:ex`, which
encourages you to do the tasks in :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`exer:some:formula`.
Appendices     :ref:`app1` and :ref:`app2` are also nice elements.


.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console


Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file:

.. code-block:: fortran

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text


        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as


.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1


Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:


.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>


Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:


.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()



Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

And a little bit of Fortran:


.. code-block:: text


        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end


HTML:


.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>


System call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the ``Verb`` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``!bsummary``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}`` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in ``a != b``,
and a Doconce directive a la ``!bc``.

Here is some <font color="red">red</font> color and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak. 

| And one more.</font> Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when HTML is the output format. 
| But here some more running text is added which is not part of

the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.



.. _subsec:ex:

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

.. index:: figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200




.. index:: movies



.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`


.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


Test URL as figure name:


.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500



.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs



**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.


.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:


.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        


Or with align with label and numbers:


.. _Eq:aligneq1:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        



.. _Eq:aligneq2:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        


Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem


.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------


.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible


.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible


.. index::
   single: index with; subindex


.. index with comma could fool sphinx


.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more


Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads

.. code-block:: text

          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

================  ================  ================  ================  
   :math:`i`        :math:`h_i`     :math:`\bar T_i`      ``L_i``       
================  ================  ================  ================  
0                                0               288           -0.0065  
1                           11,000               216               0.0  
2                           20,000               216             0.001  
3                           32,000               228            0.0028  
4                           47,000               270               0.0  
5                           51,000               270           -0.0028  
6                           71,000               214           ``NaN``  
================  ================  ================  ================  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
        exact                 ``v_1``         :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``       ``verb_3_``       
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  
                    9                   9.62                   5.57                   8.98  
                  -20                 -23.39                  -7.65                 -19.93  
                   10                  17.74                  -4.50                   9.96  
                    0                  -9.19                   4.13                  -0.26  
=====================  =====================  =====================  =====================  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

.. Mako code to expand URLs in the table

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Files ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is
some text.

Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double
quotes, with numbers like 3.14 and
newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)";
written in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct
LaTeX formatting and ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.
Here is another sentence that "caused" a bug in the past
because double backtick quotes could imply verbatim text up to
a verbatim word starting with period, like ``.txt``.


Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

.. _Example:

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with ``Example:``
and then, with the command-line option ``--examples_as_exercises`` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


**a)**
State some problem.

**Solution.**
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

**b)**
State some other problem.

**Hint 1.**
A hint can be given.

**Hint 2.**
Maybe even another hint?

**Solution.**
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`_ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`_. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`_, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`_,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`_.


.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).


.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.


More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`_, `google <http://google.com>`_, and
`google <http://google.com>`_, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. _Eq:my:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        



And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. _Eq:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: eq1
        
        a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        



.. _Eq:eq2:

.. math::
   :label: eq2
          
        b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

.. _Eq:multiline:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Testing split:

.. _Eq:split:envir:eq:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

We can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

Testing gather:

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


Testing alignat:

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2` again, and to the
alignat variant :ref:`(label:removed) <Eq:eq1a>`-:ref:`(label:removed) <Eq:eq2a>`, and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Testing eqnarray:

.. math::
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g 
        


More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------
.. keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation


.. Torture tests


Make a program that simulates flipping a coin :math:`N` times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.





Remarks  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Use ``r = random.random()`` and define head as ``r <= 0.5``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among :math:`\{1,2\}` with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---


.. --- begin answer of exercise ---

**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number :math:`<1/2`, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this :math:`N` number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**
Code:

.. code-block:: python

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

Project 3: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval :math:`[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous Doconce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw :math:`N` such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, :math:`M`, that fall in the interval :math:`(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as :math:`M/N`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- end exercise ---




.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _proj:circle1:

Project 4: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by


.. math::
        
        x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
        



.. math::
          
        y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        

where :math:`R` is the radius of the circle, :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and :math:`t` is a parameter in the unit interval :math:`[0,1]`.
For any :math:`t`, :math:`(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle:


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw :math:`N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.






Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`_ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`_ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`_.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. (**hpl 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.) I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. (**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
:math:`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among laptops and mobile units.

When several people may edit files simultaneously, it can be difficult
detect who did what when, roll back to previous versions, and to
manually merge the edits when these are incompatible. Then one needs
more sophisticated tools than Dropbox: project hosting services with
true version control systems.  (**hpl 3**: The following text aims at providing
you with the minimum information to started with such
systems. Numerous other tutorials contain more comprehensive material
and in-depth explanations of the concepts and tools.)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: ``admon.do.txt``.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\bpycod
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\epycod

And some plain text verbatim:

\bccq
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\eccq

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\bpycod
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\epycod
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\bpycod2
def f(x):
    return x
\epycod2
And a complete program

\bpypro2
print "Hello, World!"
\epypro2
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}





\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \code{mdfbox} admon also in \code{graybox2} if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\bpycod2
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\epycod2
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\bpycod2
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\epycod2
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\bpycod2
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\epycod2
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_mdfboxadmon}[Concluding remarks for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \code{remarks} and \code{hint} environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors1admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-3.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_colors1admon}





\begin{block_colors1admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors1admon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors1admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_colors1admon}




\begin{question_colors1admon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_colors1admon}




\begin{question_colors1admon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_colors1admon}




\begin{warning_colors1admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors1admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_colors1admon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_colors1admon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_colors1admon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors2admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon

\par}
\end{block_colors2admon}





\begin{block_colors2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors2admon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma

\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Point1]

\end{notice_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]

\end{question_colors2admon}

\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}





\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.

        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{graybox2admon}




Test warning with title:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Test warning with large title with math:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{graybox2admon}







\begin{graybox2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{graybox2admon}




The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{graybox2admon}




% Test one word with a number



\begin{graybox2admon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{graybox2admon}




Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).



\begin{graybox2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{graybox2admon}




\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{graybox2admon}





\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\grayboxhrules{
\textbf{Concluding remarks, for the novice:} We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
}


\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[Warning]

{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}

\par}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_grayiconadmon}[Block with title]

Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_grayiconadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_grayiconadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Point1]

\end{notice_grayiconadmon}




\begin{question_grayiconadmon}[Question]

\end{question_grayiconadmon}




\begin{question_grayiconadmon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_grayiconadmon}




\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_grayiconadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_grayiconadmon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_grayiconadmon}

The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{paragraphadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{paragraphadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{paragraphadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Block with title.]
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{paragraphadmon}





\begin{paragraphadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{paragraphadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{paragraphadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{paragraphadmon}




\begin{paragraphadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{paragraphadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{paragraphadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{paragraphadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{paragraphadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{paragraphadmon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice.]

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_yellowiconadmon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_yellowiconadmon}





\begin{block_yellowiconadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_yellowiconadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_yellowiconadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_yellowiconadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_yellowiconadmon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{question_yellowiconadmon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{question_yellowiconadmon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_yellowiconadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_yellowiconadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_yellowiconadmon}[Concluding remarks, for the novice]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_yellowiconadmon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=0mm]
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{Verbatim}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the

\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}

{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.

\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon

Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon

\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the \Verb!mdfbox! admon also in \Verb!graybox2! if
code is present).

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since

Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.


\begin{center}  % inline figure
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{center}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_mdfboxadmon}[Concluding remarks for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #BDE5F8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
</div>


<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
</div>


<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->

<p>
And then we add a figure too.

<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=400></p></center>
</div>


<h3>The end  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
</div>


<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_warning.png" hspace="5" alt="warning"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Warning.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">

</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-large">And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p></div>
</p></td></tr>

<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

<div class="alert-text-large">Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-small">Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_notice.png" hspace="5" alt="notice"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Going deeper.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>


<!-- admonition: block, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>

<div class="alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.

<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->

<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>


<!-- admonition: summary, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
</div>


<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)*exp(<span style="color: #B452CD">1</span>-x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #eeeedd"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #CD5555">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<p>

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #008b45; text-decoration: underline">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h3>Going deeper environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fbeed5"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #008b45">Dudt</span>(u):

    <span style="color: #8B008B; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half = <span style="color: #B452CD">0.5</span>
x = <span style="color: #B452CD">2</span>*n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h3>The end  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.

<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2>Introduction  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h3>Code  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h3>Quotes and boxes  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

<p>
$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h3>Admonitions  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (from !bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>

#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Testing admons

By '''hpl'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

== Introduction ==
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


==== Code ====

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>

And some plain text verbatim:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Quotes and boxes ====

Here is a plain quote environment.


{{quote box
| quote = Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
''Source'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law wikipedia]
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
}}



Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain ''box'' is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' A generic equation

:<math>
 f(x) = 0 
</math>
must be solved by a numerical method, such as


<ul>
 <li> Newton's method
 <li> The Bisection method
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting <math>f(x)=x - g(x)</math>
 <li> The Secant method
</ul>
}}


Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' :<math>
f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} </math>
}}



Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' <syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}





==== Admonitions ====

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Warning.''' And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.


<ul>
  <li> and a list
  <li> with items
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
}}



Test warning with title:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Title ending with math <math>\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4</math>.''' And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x
</syntaxhighlight>
And a complete program

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
print "Hello, World!"
</syntaxhighlight>
}}



Test warning with large title with math:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Watch out for <math>\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0</math> equations.''' Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
}}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


{{mbox
| type = Block with title.
| textstyle = font-size: 80%;
| text = '''Block with title.''' Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
''without any icon'' and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
}}





{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
}}



The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the <code>mdfbox</code> admon also in <code>graybox2</code> if
code is present).

<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: illegal-size;
| text = '''Note, eventually!''' Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <math>\theta</math> and <math>\bm{r}</math>:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
</math>
}}



<!-- Test one word with a number -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Point1.''' Ah, we are soon close to the end.
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' 
<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</ol>
}}




{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Tip.''' It is of outmost important to


<ol>
<li> stay cool
<li> read hints and tips carefully
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' And here comes some text with bad news.
}}



==== Going deeper environments ====

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Going deeper.''' We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
</syntaxhighlight>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">

    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \

Testing admons
==============

:Author: hpl
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

Introduction
============
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

Note that ``automake_sphinx.py`` fixes the HTML file generated by Sphinx
so that all styles for admonitions have a colored background.

Code
----

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:


.. code-block:: python

        def some_code(x):
            return sin(x)*exp(1-x)


And some plain text verbatim:


.. code-block:: text


        x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
        x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1


Quotes and boxes
----------------

Here is a plain quote environment.


..

    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." 
    
    | By way of corollary, it adds: 
    | "That is why academic politics are so bitter." 
    | *Source*: `wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law>`_



Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


.. warning::
    The boxes below are shown without any extra formatting in reST
    and Sphinx. We could use an admonition environment, but requires
    a title.




A plain *box* is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so (the box formatting is just ignored)
..

A generic equation


.. math::
         f(x) = 0 

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

 * Newton's method

 * The Bisection method

 * Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting :math:`f(x)=x - g(x)`

 * The Secant method

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so (the box formatting is just ignored)
..


.. math::
         f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x}


Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so (the box formatting is just ignored)
..


.. code-block:: python

        def some_code(x):
            return sin(x)*exp(1-x)




Admonitions
-----------

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


.. warning::
    And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
    test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
    in comparison with the other admons.
    
      * and a list
    
      * with items
    
    We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.




Test warning with title:


.. admonition:: Title ending with math :math:`\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4`

   And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
   
   Also some code:
   
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           def f(x):
               return x
   
   And a complete program
   
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           print "Hello, World!"




Test warning with large title with math:
(we have no impact on the font size in the title in Sphinx)


.. admonition:: Watch out for :math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0` equations

   Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
   of view.




Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


.. admonition:: Block with title

   Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
   *without any icon* and is useful when you want some admons with icon
   and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
   more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
   about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
   of understanding.




Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, for the following *block admon* (``!bblock``)
we have not specified any title, and Doconce then
applies the generic title "Notice:" for the Sphinx format:


.. admonition:: Notice

   Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
   and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.




The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!" (the comma
must be removed in the ``mdfbox`` admon also in ``graybox2`` if
code is present).

.. Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since

.. those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.



.. admonition:: Note, eventually

   Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
   But first a bit of math where we define :math:`\theta` and :math:`\boldsymbol{r}`:
   
   
   .. math::
           
           \theta &= q^2,\\
           \boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}




.. Test one word with a number



.. admonition:: Point1

   Ah, we are soon close to the end.





.. admonition:: Question

   So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?





.. admonition:: Question

    1. Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?





.. admonition:: Tip

   It is of outmost important to
   
   1. stay cool
   
   2. read hints and tips carefully
   
   Because here the thing is to do
   
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           import urllib
           
           def grab(url, filename):
               urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)




Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).
Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, we have not specified any title, and Doconce then
applies the generic title "Notice:"


.. admonition:: Notice

   And here comes some text with bad news.




Going deeper environments
-------------------------

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


.. admonition:: Going deeper

   We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
   task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
   meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
   page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
   which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.
   
   Let us start with some equations:
   
   
   .. math::
           
           \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
           \\
           \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
           \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
           
   
   
   The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
   code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.
   
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           def Dudt(u):
               r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
               return r
           
           half = 0.5
           x = 2*n
   
   And some more text that can help going into the next page.
   Longer computer code requires vertical space:
   
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           class Diff:
               def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
                   self.f = f
                   self.h = float(h)
           
           class Forward1(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
           
           class Backward1(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h
           
           class Central2(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)
           
           class Central4(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
                          (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)
           
           class Central6(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
                          (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
                          (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)
           
           class Forward3(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                           (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
   
   And then we add a figure too.
   
   
   .. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
      :width: 400





The end
-------

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


.. admonition:: Concluding remarks, for the novice

   We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
   a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
   Titles should be optional.




**Remark.**
The ``remarks`` and ``hint`` environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

Admonitions
-----------

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


Warning ---------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                |

Question ---------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                       |
|  1. Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support? |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|



Tip -----------------------------------------------------|
|                                                        |
| It is of outmost important to                          |
|                                                        |
| 1. stay cool                                           |
|                                                        |
| 2. read hints and tips carefully                       |
|                                                        |
| Because here the thing is to do::                      |
|                                                        |
|                                                        |
|         import urllib                                  |
|                                                        |
|         def grab(url, filename):                       |
|             urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename) |
|--------------------------------------------------------|


Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


|-----------------------------------------|
| And here comes some text with bad news. |
|-----------------------------------------|


Going deeper environments
-------------------------

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


Going deeper. ---------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                      |
| We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the  |
| task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the         |
| meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the     |
| page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break, |
| which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.                 |
|                                                                      |
| Let us start with some equations::                                   |
|                                                                      |
|         \begin{align*}                                               |
|         \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0                                           |
|         \\                                                           |
|         \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\                                       |
|         \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}                                |
|         \end{align*}                                                 |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
| The implementation of such complicated equations in computer         |
| code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets::          |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|         def Dudt(u):                                                 |
|             r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)                               |
|             return r                                                 |
|                                                                      |
|         half = 0.5                                                   |
|         x = 2*n                                                      |

| And some more text that can help going into the next page.           |
| Longer computer code requires vertical space::                       |

The end
-------

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


Concluding remarks, for the novice ---------------------------------|
|                                                                   |
| We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have |
| a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.              |
| Titles should be optional.                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|


*Remark.* The remarks and hint environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

DATE: Today


!split
===== Figure and bullet list =====

!bslidecell 00  0.35
!bpop

  * Here is a *wave packet*
  * It can move
  * But here it is just a figure

!epop
!eslidecell

# Test that it is okay to leave out width if there are only two columns

!bslidecell 01

!eslidecell

!bpop highlight-red
Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.
And a line more
!epop

[hpl: Here are some notes that can go to notes typesetting
in the slide environment.]

!bnotes
One can also have ordinary notes.
Over multiple lines.
!enotes

!split
===== Scientific writing needs to address many new media =====

!bpop

 * Old days (1985-2005): mostly black-and-white documents aimed at printing
 * Now: also color PDF, web pages, wikis - for paper, PC, iPad, ...
 * LaTeX writing may be very different from writing in other formats
 * Main problem:
    * LaTeX provide all sorts of fancy packages, but
    * PDF in browsers has limited capabilities (design, navigation)
      compared to native HTML formats
 * Conclusion: We need more than LaTeX

!epop

!split
===== Some math and computer code =====

!bt
\[ f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y \]
!et
Python implementation:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np

def f(x, y, t):
    return np.exp(-x*t)*np.sin(np.pi*y)

class Fancy:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __call__(self, x, y, t):
        return f(x, y, t)

f2 = Fancy()
!ec

!split
===== Admon blocks =====

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

!bnotice Key PDE:
This box has title and math in normal 90 percent font:
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
!et
!enotice

!bpop
!bnotice None
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
!enotice
!epop

!bwarning (small)
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

    <p><li class="fragment"> LaTeX provide all sorts of fancy packages, but</li>

<h3>Admon blocks  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>

<p>
Can use admons to simulate blocks:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Key PDE:</b>
This box has title and math in normal 90 percent font:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u $$

</div>


<p>

<p class="fragment">

<div class="fragment alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
</div>


</p>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-small"><b>Warning.</b>
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

======= Fundamental question =======

When I write some scientific material,

 * a LaTeX document,
 * a blog post (HTML),
 * some web pages (HTML),
 * a Sphinx document,
 * some Markdown files,

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

!bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)
!epop

!split

======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

 * LaTeX inline math: works with all (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki)
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX (can run separately), just raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; inline tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Page references: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but not on paper!)

Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.

idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).

# Make hyperlink

======= Doconce: math =======

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.


An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags,
the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}

======= Doconce: displaying code =======

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags:

!bc
|bc pycod

    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec
!ec
This gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition

        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

!bnotice Language-dependent typesetting of code:
The `!bc` command can be followed by a specification of the computer
language: `pycod` for Python code snippet, `pypro` for complete Python
program, `fcod` for Fortran snippet, `fpro` for Fortran program, and so
forth (`c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `m` for Matlab).

!split
======= Doconce: displaying interactive demo code =======
label{slide:pot}

With `!bc pyoptpro` or a file `*.pyopt`, the code applies the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com" for displaying
program flow and state of variables:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/dc_mod.pyopt




!split
======= Doconce: exercises =======

Doconce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:

!bc

<h2>Fundamental question  <a name="___sec5"></a></h2>

<p>
When I write some scientific material,

<p>

<ul>
 <p><li> a LaTeX document,</li>
 <p><li> a blog post (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> some web pages (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> a Sphinx document,</li>
 <p><li> some Markdown files,</li>
</ul>
<p>

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

<p>

<p class="fragment">

<span class="fragment highlight-red">

Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

\section{Fundamental question}

When I write some scientific material,

\begin{itemize}
 \item a {\LaTeX} document,

 \item a blog post (HTML),

 \item some web pages (HTML),

 \item a Sphinx document,

 \item some Markdown files,
\end{itemize}

\noindent
and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

## Comments start with a # and are visible as comments in the
## output. Lines starting with ## are also comments, but not visible
## in the output.

!split

## Headings have 5 = for h3/subsection and 7 = for h1/section
======= Goal =======

The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with "Doconce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
# #if FORMAT in ("html", "pdflatex", "latex")
!bnotice Layout
This version
utilizes ${SLIDE_TYPE} slides with the theme ${SLIDE_THEME}.
!enotice
# #endif

## Demonstrate use of Mako variables set on the command line
## (see last sentence too). We use Preprocess (run before Mako)
## to leave out the Mako test on SLIDE_THEME and SLIDE_TYPE.
## In that way, we do not need to specify these variables on
## the command line when compiling for LaTeX or other formats
## (e.g. for handouts).

# #if FORMAT == "html"
!bnotice
Speaker notes show up by
% if SLIDE_TYPE == 'reveal':
pressing "s".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'deck':
pressing "n".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
pressing "Ctrl-P".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'html5slides':
pressing "p".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
using the "onstage.html": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/dzslides/shells/onstage.html" embedding page.
% endif
!enotice
# #endif

## Add speaker notes (can also use preprocess or mako for this)

!bnotes
The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u'=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.
!enotes

## New slide is indicated by !split at the beginning of a line:

======= Mathematical problem =======

## Use !bslidecell XY and !eslidecell as begin and end for
## defining a cell XY in a table layout of the slide.
## X=0,1,..., Y=0,1,... XY=00 is the upper left cell.
## Here we define cell 00 and 01 (bullet list to the left
## and figure to the right).

 * $t\in (0,T]$
 * $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters
 * $u(t)$ is the unknown function

## Figures can have a width parameter specifying the pixel
## width in HTML. A caption can be added (after [...]).

======= Numerical solution method =======

## !bpop and !epop surround elements that are to pop up
## as we progress in the slide show.
## They will often not work if there is code inside.

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

!bpop
Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

# #if FORMAT == "html"

!split
## Next: embed YouTube video

===== Forward Euler explained =====

MOVIE: [http://youtu.be/PtJrPEIHNJw, width=640 height=480]

# #endif

!split
## Next: exemplify copying code directly from file (start
## with the line matching "def solver" and ending with
## "def verify_three", but not including this last line).

======= Implementation =======

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver@def verify_three

!split
===== The Crank-Nicolson method =====

## Figure filenames do not need extension - the right version is picked

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/CN, width=600]

!split
===== The artifacts can be explained by some theory =====

!bpop
Exact solution of the scheme:

!bt
\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
!et
!epop

!bpop
 * Stability: $|A| < 1$
 * No oscillations: $A>0$
 * Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)
 * $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)
 * $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
!epop

## The summary environment appears in a box in most formats
## (warning, notice, hint, question are other environments)
!bpop
!bsummary Concluding remarks:
Only the Backward Euler scheme is guaranteed to always give
qualitatively correct results.

<h2>Goal  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" target="_self">Doconce</a>
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Layout.</b>
This version
utilizes reveal slides with the theme beigesmall.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Notice.</b>
Speaker notes show up by
pressing "s".
</div>


<p>
<aside class="notes">
<!-- click "s" to activate -->

The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation \( u'=-au \) with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.

    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition

OK, this is fixed:


```Python
def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c

```

### Updated task list

   - [x] Offer an `f(x)` function

   - [ ] Extension to cubic functions

   - [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function

#### Remaining functionality

may actually be the MP4 version of this movie
three alternative sources (MP4, WebM, OGG)
are inserted in the HTML code by default. The command-line
option `--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives` makes the HTML
code use exactly the specified movie file.
# #endif

MOVIE: [../doc/src/manual/mov/wave.webm, width=700 height=400] 1D wave in WebM.

Here is the same movie in Ogg format:

Here is a movie in WebM format.
Note that in HTML format a WebM movie
may actually be the MP4 version of this movie
three alternative sources (MP4, WebM, OGG)
are inserted in the HTML code by default. The command-line
option <code>--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives</code> makes the HTML
code use exactly the specified movie file.

========= Preface =========

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to *think* as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, URL:
"http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer", which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

=== Python version 2 or 3? ===

A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool *2to3* to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
`a/b` implies float division in version 3 if `a` and `b`
are integers,
and `print 'Hello'` in version 2 must be turned into a function call
`print('Hello')` in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

========= Basic array computing and plotting =========

This ${CHAPTER} gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
${CHAPTER} we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this ${CHAPTER} can be found as files in the
folder "`src/plot`": "${src_path}/plot".

======= Arrays in Python programs =======

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

===== Using lists for collecting function data =====
label{sec:plot:listdata}

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

!bc py
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
!ec
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard `for` loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

idx{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
`pairs` is a list of two `float` objects, while any element in `xlist`
or `ylist` is a `float`. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

!bc pycod
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
!ec
Here `mylist` holds an `int`, a `float`, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
*heterogeneous* lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this ${BOOK}.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

===== Basics of numerical Python arrays =====
label{sec:plot:array:basics}

idx{Numerical Python} idx{NumPy} idx{`numpy`}
idx{array (datatype)} idx{array computing}
idx{vectorization}

An *array* object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

  * All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.
  * The number of elements must be known when the array is created.
  * Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called *Numerical Python*, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in `import` statements, is `numpy`.
  * With `numpy`, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called *vectorization* %or *array computing* and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.
  * Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.

!bnotice Remarks

 o There is actually an
   object type called `array` in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this ${BOOK}.
 o The number of elements in an array *can* be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.

The following text lists some important functionality of NumPy arrays.
A more comprehensive treatment is found in the excellent *NumPy
Tutorial*, *NumPy User Guide*, *NumPy Reference*, *Guide to NumPy*,
and *NumPy for MATLAB Users*, all accessible at "scipy.org":

idx{`zeros` (from `numpy`)} idx{`np.zeros` function}
idx{`array` (from `numpy`)} idx{`np.array` function}
idx{`np` prefix (`numpy`)}
idx{`zeros_like` (from `numpy`)}idx{`np.zeros_like` function}


!bnotice Remarks on importing NumPy
The statement

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
!ec
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by `np.`,
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

!bc pycod
from numpy import *
!ec
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
*interactive* Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from `numpy` to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

!bc pycod
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
!ec
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach `from numpy import *` and fill up
the program with *a lot* of functions and variables from `numpy`.
!enotice

To convert a list `r` to an array,
we use the `array` function
from `numpy`:

!bc pycod
a = np.array(r)
!ec
To create a new array of length `n`, filled with zeros, we write

!bc pycod
a = np.zeros(n)
!ec
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
`float` type. A second argument to `np.zeros` can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., `int`.
A similar function,

!bc pycod
a = np.zeros_like(c)
!ec
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array `c`
and the element type is the same as those in `c`.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

idx{`linspace` (from `numpy`)}idx{`np.linspace` function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The `numpy` function
`linspace` creates such arrays:

!bc pycod
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
!ec


========= Storing results in data files =========

We need to test spaces around footnotes for 2-digit footnotes, which
means we need a lot of URLs, e.g., to files:
"`ball2_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/ball2_cml.py",
"`bisection_ex.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_ex.py",
"`bisection_movie.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_movie.py",
"`bisection_plot.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_plot.py",
"`bisection.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection.py",
"`bisection_v1.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_v1.py",
"`bisection_v2.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_v2.py",
"`c2f_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/c2f_cml.py",
"`data.txt`": "${src_path}/input/data.txt",
"`Fdeg.dat`": "${src_path}/input/Fdeg.dat",
"`integrate.py`": "${src_path}/input/integrate.py", and
"`interest.py`": "${src_path}/input/interest.py".

======= Writing data to file =======
label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: `outfile.write(s)`,
which writes a string `s` to
a file handled by the file object `outfile`. Unlike `print`,
`outfile.write(s)`
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

!bc pycod
outfile.write(s + '\n')
!ec
if the string `s` is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and `s` does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
`outfile.write`.

Writing to a file demands
the file object `f`
to be opened for writing:

!bc pycod
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
!ec

===== Example: Writing a table to file =====

=== Problem ===

As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

!bc ccq
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
!ec

=== Solution ===

We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file "`write1.py`": "${src_path}/input/write1.py".

The resulting data file becomes

!bc dat
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
!ec

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

!bc dat
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
!ec
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program `write1.py`. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

!bc pycod
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
!ec
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as `'column  ' + str(i)`, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in `i`.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

!bc pycod
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
!ec
The complete code is found in the file "`write2.py`": "${src_path}/input/write2.py".
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

!bc pycod
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
!ec
Some other files and URLs we can mention, just to test a 2-digit footnote,
are

 * "`addall.py`": "${src_path}/input/addall.py"
 * "`addall_v1.py`": "${src_path}/input/addall_v1.py"
 * "`add_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/add_cml.py"
 * "`add_input.py`": "${src_path}/input/add_input.py"



===== Standard input and output as file objects =====

idx{standard input} idx{standard output}

idx{`sys.stdin`}idx{`sys.stdout`}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
# #ifdef PRIMER_BOOK
`raw_input` as explained in Section ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
# #else
`raw_input`.
# #endif
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as *standard input*.

The `print` command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
*standard output*. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
`raw_input`
and `print` in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
`sys.stdin` for standard input
and `sys.stdout` for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

!bc pycod
s = raw_input('Give s:')
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
!ec
Recall that the trailing comma in the `print` statement avoids the
newline that `print` by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

!bc pycod
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
!ec
For output to the terminal window, the statement

!bc pycod
print s
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
!ec

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object `infile`
and writes data to a file object `outfile`.
A sample function may take the form

!bc pycod
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
!ec
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as `infile` (see Section ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With `sys.stdin` as `infile` and/or `sys.stdout`
as `outfile`, the `x2f` function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`,
we would need different code, employing `raw_input`
and `print`,
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

idx{standard error}
idx{`sys.stderr`}

There is also something called *standard error*.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object `sys.stderr`.
A typical application of `sys.stderr` is to report errors:

!bc pycod
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
!ec
This message to `sys.stderr` is an alternative to
`print` or raising an exception.

=== Redirecting standard input, output, and error ===

Standard output from a program `prog`
can be redirected to a file
`output` instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog > output
!ec
Here, `prog` can be any
program, including a Python program run as `python myprog.py`.
Similarly, output to the medium called *standard error*
can be redirected by

!bc sys
Terminal> prog &> output
!ec
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

!bc sys
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
!ec
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name `raw_input`, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog < input
!ec
Combinations are also possible:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog < input > output
!ec

=== Note ===

The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the `run`
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\chapter*{Preface}
\markboth{Preface}{Preface}

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to \emph{think} as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}{\nolinkurl{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}, which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

\paragraph{Python version 2 or 3?}
A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool \emph{2to3} to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
\code{a/b} implies float division in version 3 if \code{a} and \code{b}
are integers,
and \code{print 'Hello'} in version 2 must be turned into a function call
\code{print('Hello')} in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
Several people have helped to make substantial improvements of the
text. Here I list only the names with Norwgian characters to
test the handling of those: Ståle Zerener Haugnæss,
Tobias Vidarssønn Langhoff, and Håkon Møller.

\chapter{Basic array computing and plotting}

This chapter gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
chapter we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this chapter can be found as files in the
folder \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}{\nolinkurl{src/plot}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}}.

\section{Arrays in Python programs}

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

\subsection{Using lists for collecting function data}
\label{sec:plot:listdata}

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

\bpy
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
\epy
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard \code{for} loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

\index{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
\code{pairs} is a list of two \code{float} objects, while any element in \code{xlist}
or \code{ylist} is a \code{float}. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

\bpycod
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
\epycod
Here \code{mylist} holds an \code{int}, a \code{float}, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
\emph{heterogeneous} lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this book.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

\subsection{Basics of numerical Python arrays}
\label{sec:plot:array:basics}

\index{Numerical Python} \index{NumPy} \index{numpy@{\rm\texttt{numpy}}}
\index{array (datatype)} \index{array computing}
\index{vectorization}

An \emph{array} object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.

  \item The number of elements must be known when the array is created.

  \item Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called \emph{Numerical Python}, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in \code{import} statements, is \code{numpy}.

  \item With \code{numpy}, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called \emph{vectorization} %or \emph{array computing} and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section~\ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.

  \item Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks.]

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is actually an
   object type called \code{array} in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this book.

\item The number of elements in an array \emph{can} be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



The following text lists some important functionality of NumPy arrays.
A more comprehensive treatment is found in the excellent \emph{NumPy
Tutorial}, \emph{NumPy User Guide}, \emph{NumPy Reference}, \emph{Guide to NumPy},
and \emph{NumPy for MATLAB Users}, all accessible at \href{{http://scipy.org}}{scipy.org}\footnote{\texttt{http://scipy.org}}.

\index{array@{\rm\texttt{array}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})} \index{np.array@{\rm\texttt{np.array}} function}
\index{np@{\rm\texttt{np}} prefix ({\rm\texttt{numpy}})}
\index{zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{zeros\_like}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{np.zeros\_like}} function}



\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks on importing NumPy.]
The statement

\bpycod
import numpy as np
\epycod
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by \code{np.},
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

\bpycod
from numpy import *
\epycod
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
\emph{interactive} Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from \code{numpy} to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

\bpycod
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
\epycod
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach \code{from numpy import *} and fill up
the program with \emph{a lot} of functions and variables from \code{numpy}.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



To convert a list \code{r} to an array,
we use the \code{array} function
from \code{numpy}:

\bpycod
a = np.array(r)
\epycod
To create a new array of length \code{n}, filled with zeros, we write

\bpycod
a = np.zeros(n)
\epycod
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
\code{float} type. A second argument to \code{np.zeros} can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., \code{int}.
A similar function,

\bpycod
a = np.zeros_like(c)
\epycod
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array \code{c}
and the element type is the same as those in \code{c}.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section~\ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

\index{linspace@{\rm\texttt{linspace}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.linspace@{\rm\texttt{np.linspace}} function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The \code{numpy} function
\code{linspace} creates such arrays:

\bpycod
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
\epycod


\chapter{Storing results in data files}

We need to test spaces around footnotes for 2-digit footnotes, which
means we need a lot of URLs, e.g., to files:
\href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/ball2_cml.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2_cml.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/ball2\_cml.py}}},

\section{Writing data to file}
\label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: \code{outfile.write(s)},
which writes a string \code{s} to
a file handled by the file object \code{outfile}. Unlike \code{print},
\code{outfile.write(s)}
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

\bpycod
outfile.write(s + '\n')
\epycod
if the string \code{s} is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and \code{s} does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
\code{outfile.write}.

Writing to a file demands
the file object \code{f}
to be opened for writing:

\bpycod
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
\epycod

\subsection{Example: Writing a table to file}

\paragraph{Problem.}
As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

\bccq
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
\eccq

\paragraph{Solution.}
We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}{\nolinkurl{write1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}}.

The resulting data file becomes

\bdat
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\edat

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

\bdat
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\edat
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program \code{write1.py}. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

\bpycod
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
\epycod
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as \code{'column  ' + str(i)}, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in \code{i}.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

\bpycod
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
\epycod
The complete code is found in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}{\nolinkurl{write2.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}}.
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

\bpycod
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
\epycod
Some other files and URLs we can mention, just to test a 2-digit footnote,
are

\begin{itemize}
 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}{\nolinkurl{addall.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}}

 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall_v1.py}}{\nolinkurl{addall_v1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall\_v1.py}}}

 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/add_cml.py}}{\nolinkurl{add_cml.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/add\_cml.py}}}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Standard input and output as file objects}

\index{standard input} \index{standard output}

\index{sys.stdin@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdin}}}\index{sys.stdout@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdout}}}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
\code{raw_input} as explained in Section~\ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as \emph{standard input}.

The \code{print} command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
\emph{standard output}. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
\code{raw_input}
and \code{print} in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
\code{sys.stdin} for standard input
and \code{sys.stdout} for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

\bpycod
s = raw_input('Give s:')
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
\epycod
Recall that the trailing comma in the \code{print} statement avoids the
newline that \code{print} by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

\bpycod
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
\epycod
For output to the terminal window, the statement

\bpycod
print s
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
\epycod

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object \code{infile}
and writes data to a file object \code{outfile}.
A sample function may take the form

\bpycod
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
\epycod
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as \code{infile} (see Section~\ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With \code{sys.stdin} as \code{infile} and/or \code{sys.stdout}
as \code{outfile}, the \code{x2f} function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without \code{sys.stdin} and \code{sys.stdout},
we would need different code, employing \code{raw_input}
and \code{print},
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

\index{standard error}
\index{sys.stderr@{\rm\texttt{sys.stderr}}}

There is also something called \emph{standard error}.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object \code{sys.stderr}.
A typical application of \code{sys.stderr} is to report errors:

\bpycod
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
\epycod
This message to \code{sys.stderr} is an alternative to
\code{print} or raising an exception.

\paragraph{Redirecting standard input, output, and error.}
Standard output from a program \code{prog}
can be redirected to a file
\code{output} instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

\bsys
Terminal> prog > output
\esys
Here, \code{prog} can be any
program, including a Python program run as \code{python myprog.py}.
Similarly, output to the medium called \emph{standard error}
can be redirected by

\bsys
Terminal> prog &> output
\esys
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

\bsys
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
\esys
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name \code{raw_input}, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

\bsys
Terminal> prog < input
\esys
Combinations are also possible:

\bsys
Terminal> prog < input > output
\esys

\paragraph{Note.}
The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the \code{run}
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\paragraph{References.}
To check the bibliography, we need to make citations to a book{TCSE3},
Matplotlib \cite{Matplotlib:paper}, and more books \cite{Mertz,PythonQt}
as well as Python itself \cite{Python}, and of course NumPy
\cite{NumPy}.

\chapter*{Preface}
\markboth{Preface}{Preface}

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to \emph{think} as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}{\nolinkurl{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}, which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

\paragraph{Python version 2 or 3?}
A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool \emph{2to3} to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
\texttt{a/b} implies float division in version 3 if \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}
are integers,
and \texttt{print 'Hello'} in version 2 must be turned into a function call
\texttt{print('Hello')} in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
Several people have helped to make substantial improvements of the
text. Here I list only the names with Norwgian characters to
test the handling of those: Ståle Zerener Haugnæss,
Tobias Vidarssønn Langhoff, and Håkon Møller.

\chapter{Basic array computing and plotting}

This chapter gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
chapter we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this chapter can be found as files in the
folder \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}{\nolinkurl{src/plot}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}}.

\section{Arrays in Python programs}

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

\subsection{Using lists for collecting function data}
\label{sec:plot:listdata}

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.87843, 0.95686, 1.0}
\renewenvironment{shadedskip}{
\def\FrameCommand{\colorbox{shadecolor}}\FrameRule0.6pt
\MakeFramed {\FrameRestore}\vskip3mm}{\vskip0mm\endMakeFramed}
\providecommand{\shadedquoteBlue}{}
\renewenvironment{shadedquoteBlue}[1][]{
\bgroup\rmfamily
\fboxsep=0mm\relax
\begin{shadedskip}
\list{}{\parsep=-2mm\parskip=0mm\topsep=0pt\leftmargin=2mm
\rightmargin=2\leftmargin\leftmargin=4pt\relax}
\item\relax}
{\endlist\end{shadedskip}\egroup}\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard \texttt{for} loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

\index{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
\texttt{pairs} is a list of two \texttt{float} objects, while any element in \texttt{xlist}
or \texttt{ylist} is a \texttt{float}. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

\providecommand{\shadedskip}{}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.87843, 0.95686, 1.0}
\renewenvironment{shadedskip}{
\def\FrameCommand{\colorbox{shadecolor}}\FrameRule0.6pt
\MakeFramed {\FrameRestore}\vskip3mm}{\vskip0mm\endMakeFramed}
\providecommand{\shadedquoteBlue}{}
\renewenvironment{shadedquoteBlue}[1][]{
\bgroup\rmfamily
\fboxsep=0mm\relax
\begin{shadedskip}
\list{}{\parsep=-2mm\parskip=0mm\topsep=0pt\leftmargin=2mm
\rightmargin=2\leftmargin\leftmargin=4pt\relax}
\item\relax}
{\endlist\end{shadedskip}\egroup}\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Here \texttt{mylist} holds an \texttt{int}, a \texttt{float}, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
\emph{heterogeneous} lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this book.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

\subsection{Basics of numerical Python arrays}
\label{sec:plot:array:basics}

\index{Numerical Python} \index{NumPy} \index{numpy@{\rm\texttt{numpy}}}
\index{array (datatype)} \index{array computing}
\index{vectorization}

An \emph{array} object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.

  \item The number of elements must be known when the array is created.

  \item Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called \emph{Numerical Python}, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in \texttt{import} statements, is \texttt{numpy}.

  \item With \texttt{numpy}, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called \emph{vectorization} %or \emph{array computing} and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section~\ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.

  \item Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks.]

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is actually an
   object type called \texttt{array} in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this book.

\item The number of elements in an array \emph{can} be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



The following text lists some important functionality of NumPy arrays.
A more comprehensive treatment is found in the excellent \emph{NumPy
Tutorial}, \emph{NumPy User Guide}, \emph{NumPy Reference}, \emph{Guide to NumPy},
and \emph{NumPy for MATLAB Users}, all accessible at \href{{http://scipy.org}}{scipy.org}\footnote{\texttt{http://scipy.org}}.


\index{zeros@{\rm\texttt{zeros}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})} \index{np.zeros@{\rm\texttt{np.zeros}} function}
\index{array@{\rm\texttt{array}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})} \index{np.array@{\rm\texttt{np.array}} function}
\index{np@{\rm\texttt{np}} prefix ({\rm\texttt{numpy}})}
\index{zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{zeros\_like}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{np.zeros\_like}} function}



\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks on importing NumPy.]
The statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
import numpy as np
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by \texttt{np.},
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
from numpy import *
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
\emph{interactive} Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from \texttt{numpy} to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach \texttt{from numpy import *} and fill up
the program with \emph{a lot} of functions and variables from \texttt{numpy}.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



To convert a list \texttt{r} to an array,
we use the \texttt{array} function
from \texttt{numpy}:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.array(r)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
To create a new array of length \texttt{n}, filled with zeros, we write

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.zeros(n)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
\texttt{float} type. A second argument to \texttt{np.zeros} can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., \texttt{int}.
A similar function,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.zeros_like(c)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array \texttt{c}
and the element type is the same as those in \texttt{c}.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section~\ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

\index{linspace@{\rm\texttt{linspace}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.linspace@{\rm\texttt{np.linspace}} function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The \texttt{numpy} function
\texttt{linspace} creates such arrays:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent


\chapter{Storing results in data files}

We need to test spaces around footnotes for 2-digit footnotes, which
means we need a lot of URLs, e.g., to files:
\href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/ball2_cml.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2_cml.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/ball2\_cml.py}}},

\section{Writing data to file}
\label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: \texttt{outfile.write(s)},
which writes a string \texttt{s} to
a file handled by the file object \texttt{outfile}. Unlike \texttt{print},
\texttt{outfile.write(s)}
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
outfile.write(s + '\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
if the string \texttt{s} is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and \texttt{s} does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
\texttt{outfile.write}.

Writing to a file demands
the file object \texttt{f}
to be opened for writing:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent

\subsection{Example: Writing a table to file}

\paragraph{Problem.}
As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{Solution.}
We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}{\nolinkurl{write1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}}.

The resulting data file becomes

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program \texttt{write1.py}. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as \texttt{'column  ' + str(i)}, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in \texttt{i}.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
The complete code is found in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}{\nolinkurl{write2.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}}.
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Some other files and URLs we can mention, just to test a 2-digit footnote,
are

 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}{\nolinkurl{addall.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Standard input and output as file objects}

\index{standard input} \index{standard output}

\index{sys.stdin@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdin}}}\index{sys.stdout@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdout}}}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
{\Verb!raw_input!} as explained in Section~\ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as \emph{standard input}.

The \texttt{print} command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
\emph{standard output}. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
{\Verb!raw_input!}
and \texttt{print} in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
\texttt{sys.stdin} for standard input
and \texttt{sys.stdout} for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
s = raw_input('Give s:')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Recall that the trailing comma in the \texttt{print} statement avoids the
newline that \texttt{print} by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
For output to the terminal window, the statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print s
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object \texttt{infile}
and writes data to a file object \texttt{outfile}.
A sample function may take the form

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as \texttt{infile} (see Section~\ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With \texttt{sys.stdin} as \texttt{infile} and/or \texttt{sys.stdout}
as \texttt{outfile}, the \texttt{x2f} function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without \texttt{sys.stdin} and \texttt{sys.stdout},
we would need different code, employing {\Verb!raw_input!}
and \texttt{print},
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

\index{standard error}
\index{sys.stderr@{\rm\texttt{sys.stderr}}}

There is also something called \emph{standard error}.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object \texttt{sys.stderr}.
A typical application of \texttt{sys.stderr} is to report errors:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
This message to \texttt{sys.stderr} is an alternative to
\texttt{print} or raising an exception.

\paragraph{Redirecting standard input, output, and error.}
Standard output from a program \texttt{prog}
can be redirected to a file
\texttt{output} instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog > output
\end{Verbatim}
Here, \texttt{prog} can be any
program, including a Python program run as \texttt{python myprog.py}.
Similarly, output to the medium called \emph{standard error}
can be redirected by

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog &> output
\end{Verbatim}
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
\end{Verbatim}
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name {\Verb!raw_input!}, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog < input
\end{Verbatim}
Combinations are also possible:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog < input > output
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Note.}
The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the \texttt{run}
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\paragraph{References.}
To check the bibliography, we need to make citations to a book{TCSE3},
Matplotlib \cite{Matplotlib:paper}, and more books \cite{Mertz,PythonQt}
as well as Python itself \cite{Python}, and of course NumPy
\cite{NumPy}.

with special typesetting, such as <tt>fixed width fonts</tt>
in plain text.

<h3>First Subsection</h3>
Some text for the subsection.

<p><!-- paragraph with heading -->
<b>Test of a Paragraph.</b>

Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:
<ol> <!-- start of "enumerate" list -->
<p><li> item1
<p><li> item2

  <ol> <!-- start of "enumerate" list -->
    <p><li> subitem1
    <p><li> subitem2
  </ol> <!-- end of "enumerate" list -->
<p><li> item3

  <ol> <!-- start of "enumerate" list -->
    <p><li> subitem3
    <p><li> subitem4
  </ol> <!-- end of "enumerate" list -->
</ol> <!-- end of "enumerate" list -->
...with some trailing text.
<h4>First Subsubsection with an Itemize List</h4>

<ul> <!-- start of "itemize" list -->
<p><li> item1
<p><li> item2

  <ul> <!-- start of "itemize" list -->
    <p><li> subitem1
    <p><li> subitem2
  </ul> <!-- end of "itemize" list -->
<p><li> item3

  <ul> <!-- start of "itemize" list -->
    <p><li> subitem3
    <p><li> subitem4
  </ul> <!-- end of "itemize" list -->
</ul> <!-- end of "itemize" list -->
Here is some Python code:
<pre>
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

</pre>

<h1>Second Section</h1>
Here is a description list:
<dl> <!-- start of "description" list -->
<p><dt>keyword1</dt><dd> item1</dd>
<p><dt>keyword2</dt><dd> item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after</dd>

  <dl> <!-- start of "description" list -->
    <p><dt>key3</dt><dd> subitem1</dd>
    <p><dt>key4</dt><dd> subitem2</dd>
  </dl> <!-- end of "description" list -->
<p><dt>key5</dt><dd> item3</dd>

  <dl> <!-- start of "description" list -->

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="quickref.do.txt">quickref.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce quickref, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html quickref.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="quickref.html">quickref.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex quickref.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="quickref.tex">quickref.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="quickref.pdf">quickref.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    quickref.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx quickref.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="quickref.rst">quickref.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="quickref.xml">XML</a>, <a href="quickref.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="quickref.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="quickref.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="quickref.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="quickref.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="quickref.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.mwiki">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.md">aPandoc</a>,
<a href="quickref.st">Structured Text</a>,
<a href="quickref.epytext">Epytext</a>,
and maybe the most important format of all:
<a href="quickref.txt">plain untagged ASCII text</a>.

TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today
TOC: on

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

__Mission.__ Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

===== Supported Formats =====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


===== Emacs syntax support =====

The file ".doconce-mode.el":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el"
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Emacs key      | Action                                |
|----l-------------------------l-------------------------|
|  Ctrl+c f      | figure                                |
|  Ctrl+c v      | movie/video                           |
|  Ctrl+c h1     | heading level 1 (section/h1)          |
|  Ctrl+c h2     | heading level 2 (subsection/h2)       |
|  Ctrl+c h3     | heading level 2 (subsection/h3)       |

|  Ctrl+c slide  | slide outline                         |
|  Ctrl+c help   | print this table                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|

===== Title, Authors, and Date =====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
!ec
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
!bc
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
!ec
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


===== Section Types =====
label{quick:sections}

|----------------c---------------------------c---------------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                                |
|----------------l---------------------------l---------------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         |
| abstract                | `__Abstract.__` Running text...              |
| appendix                | `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| appendix                | `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
| exercise                | `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| exercise                | `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

===== Inline Formatting =====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text
!bc
`color{red}{two red words}`
!ec
becomes color{red}{two red words}.

===== Lists =====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
!bc
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
!ec
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line


===== Comment lines =====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


===== Inline comments =====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
!bc
[name: running text]
!ec
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
!ec
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
!bc sys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

===== Verbatim/Computer Code =====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
!bc
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
!ec
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

!bc cod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
!ec

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
!bc
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
!ec
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes `shpro` even if we copy a part
of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
!bc
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
!ec
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
## Note: |bt and |et (and |bc and |ec below) are used to illustrate
## tex and code blocks in inside verbatim blocks and are replaced
## by !bt, !et, !bc, and !ec after all other formatting is finished.

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
Here is a single equation:

!bc
|bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
|et
!ec
which results in

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

!bnotice
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
!enotice

__LaTeX Newcommands.__
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


===== Hyperlinks =====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

!bc
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
!ec

===== Figures and Movies =====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
!bc
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

!ec
Note three important syntax details:

  o A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
  o no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,
  o all of the command must appear on a single line,
  o there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
!bc sys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
!ec
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

!ec
The latter results in

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.


===== Tables =====

The table in Section ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
!bc
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
!ec

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

===== Labels and References =====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
!bc
label{name}
!ec
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
!bc
ref{name}
!ec
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


===== Citations and Bibliography =====

Single citations are written as
!bc
cite{name}
!ec
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
!bc
cite{name1,name2,name3}
!ec

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
"Publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

===== Generalized Citations =====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
!bc
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
!ec
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`ref{label}` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

===== Index of Keywords =====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
!bc
index{name}
!ec
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

===== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` =====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

@@@CODE doconce_program.sh

===== Exercises =====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
!bc
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

|bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
|ehint

|bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
|ehint
!ec
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

!bc
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
!ec
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

|bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

|bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
|eans

|bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
|ehint

|bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

|bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
|ehint

|bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
|esol
|esubex

|bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
|eremarks

|bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
|esol

!ec
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


===== Environments =====

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide


===== Preprocessing =====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

!bc
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
!ec

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "example document": "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

<p>
<b>WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!</b>

<p>
<b>Mission.</b>
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code <em>once, in one place</em> and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

<h3>Supported Formats  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)</li>
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)</li>
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)</li>
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)</li>
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)</li>
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)</li>
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)</li>
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)</li>
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)</li>
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

<h3>Emacs syntax support  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>

<p>
The file <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el" target="_self">.doconce-mode.el</a>
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

<p>
Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                          Emacs key                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                            Action                            </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f                                                        </td> <td align="left">   figure                                                          </td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h2                                                       </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h2)                                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h3                                                       </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h3)                                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c hp                                                       </td> <td align="left">   heading for paragraph                                           </td> </tr>

<h3>Title, Authors, and Date  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>

<p>
A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory &amp; Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 &amp; institution2
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

<p>
The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

<p>
The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.

<h3>Section Types <a name="quick:sections"></a></h3>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                            Section type                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                               Syntax                              </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section                                                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection                                                           </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection                                                        </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph                                                            </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Appendix: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Appendix: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Exercise: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise                                                             </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Exercise: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

<p>
The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

<h3>Inline Formatting  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>

<p>
Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
<em>emphasized words</em>. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes <b>boldface</b>. Colored words
are also possible: the text
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>`color{red}{two red words}`
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

<h3>Lists  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>

<p>
There are three types of lists: <em>bullet lists</em>, where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, <em>enumeration lists</em>, where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and <em>description</em> lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The code above follows.

<p>
Here is a bullet list:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> item1</li>
 <li> item2</li>

<ul>
  <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
  <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ul>

 <li> item3</li>
</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines</li>

<ol>
 <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
 <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ol>

<li> item3</li>
</ol>

And finally a description list:

<p>

<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

<h3>Comment lines  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>

<p>
Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

<p>
Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

<p>
Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

<p>
When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.

<h3>Inline comments  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>

<p>
Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>[name: running text]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. Here goes an example.

<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.</em>]</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->

The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the <code>-DTOTONOTES</code> option to <code>ptex2tex</code> or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the <code>todonotes</code> package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

<p>
Running
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

<p>
All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h3>Verbatim/Computer Code  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>

<p>
Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

<p>
Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

<p>
The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<p>
Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre><code>from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code> @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the <em>regular
expression</em> <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including the line
matching the <em>regular expression</em> <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

<p>
The copied lines from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active
for <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, html`, and <code>sphinx</code> outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes <code>shpro</code> even if we copy a part
of the file (here from <code>name=</code> until the end of the file).

<p>
Important warnings:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.</li>
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

<p>
Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
\( Ax=b \). To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

<p>
Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &amp;= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
This LaTeX code gets rendered as

<p>
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

Here is a single equation:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
which results in

<p>
$$ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.$$


<p>
Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>,
    <code>equation</code>, <code>equation*</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>align*</code>.</li>
  <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.</li>
</ul>

(Doconce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Notice.</b>
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code>, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
</div>


<p>
<b>LaTeX Newcommands.</b>
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.

<h3>Hyperlinks  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>

<p>
Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is some &quot;some link text&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/address&quot;
(as in &quot;search google&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;)
or just the raw address: URL: &quot;http://google.com&quot;.

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
&quot;`myfile.py`&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py&quot;.

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
&quot;`hpl@simula.no`&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;
or just &quot;send mail&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h3>Figures and Movies  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>

<p>
Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Note three important syntax details:

<p>

<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,</li>
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,</li>
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,</li>
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.</li>
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

<p>
The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

<p>
Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

<p>
Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

<p>
YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The latter results in

<p>

<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>

<h3>Tables  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>

<p>
The table in the section <a href="#quick:sections">Section Types</a> was written with this
syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).</li>
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.</li>
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.</li>
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

<h3>Labels and References  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>

<p>
The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>label{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, say <code>a:b:c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<code>c</code> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

<p>
A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>ref{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

<p>
Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

<h3>Citations and Bibliography  <a name="___sec14"></a></h3>

<p>
Single citations are written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name1,name2,name3}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" target="_self">Publish</a> format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

<h3>Generalized Citations  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>

<p>
There is a <em>generalized referencing</em> feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;testdoc.html#___sec2&quot; in the document
&quot;A Document for Testing Doconce&quot;: &quot;testdoc.html&quot; cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
<code>ref{label}</code> references in <code>internal</code> are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

<h3>Index of Keywords  <a name="___sec16"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>index{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

<h3>Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code>  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>

<p>
The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<p>

<h3>Exercises  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce supports <em>Exercise</em>, <em>Problem</em>, <em>Project</em>, and <em>Example</em>.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain <em>elements</em>:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)</li>
  <li> a label (optional)</li>
  <li> a solution file (optional)</li>
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)</li>
  <li> main exercise text (required)</li>
  <li> a short answer (optional)</li>
  <li> a full solution (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more hints (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)</li>
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
&quot;Wolframalpha&quot;: &quot;http://wolframalpha.com&quot; can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

<p>
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

<h3>Environments  <a name="___sec19"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)</li>
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax</li>
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text</li>
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color</li>
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations</li>
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preprocessing  <a name="___sec20"></a></h3>

<p>
Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

<p>
The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># #include &quot;myotherdoc.do.txt&quot;

# #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          &amp; 1.4186       &amp; -5.01        \\ 
2.0          &amp; 1.376512     &amp; 11.919       \\ 
4.0          &amp; 1.1E+1       &amp; 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" target="_self">example document</a> contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

\textbf{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

\paragraph{Mission.}
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code \emph{once, in one place} and include it in traditional {\LaTeX}
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's \code{blogger.com}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

\subsection{Supported Formats}

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\LaTeX} (format \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex})

 \item HTML (format \code{html})

 \item reStructuredText (format \code{rst})

 \item plain (untagged) ASCII (format \code{plain})

 \item Sphinx (format \code{sphinx})

 \item IPython notebook (format \code{ipynb})

 \item MediaWiki (format \code{mwiki})

 \item (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format \code{pandoc})

 \item Googlecode wiki (format \code{gwiki})

 \item Creoloe wiki (format \code{cwiki})

 \item Epydoc (format \code{epydoc})

 \item StructuredText (format \code{st})
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex}, \code{sphinx}, and \code{html}; and to a slightly
less extent \code{mwiki} and \code{pandoc}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


\subsection{Emacs syntax support}

The file \href{{https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el}}{.doconce-mode.el}
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
\code{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")} to the \code{.emacs} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Emacs key } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Action } \\
\hline
Ctrl+c f                                         & figure                                           \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\subsection{Title, Authors, and Date}

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
\bccq
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
\eccq
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
\bccq
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
\eccq
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the \code{&} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword \code{and} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from \code{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., \code{Jan 32, 2100}.

The table of contents is removed by writing \code{TOC: off}.


\subsection{Section Types}
\label{quick:sections}


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Section type } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Syntax } \\
\hline
chapter                                               & \code{========= Heading ========} (9 \code{=})        \\
section                                               & \code{======= Heading =======}    (7 \code{=})        \\
subsection                                            & \code{===== Heading =====}        (5 \code{=})        \\
subsubsection                                         & \code{=== Heading ===}            (3 \code{=})        \\
paragraph                                             & \code{__Heading.__}               (2 \code{_})        \\
abstract                                              & \code{__Abstract.__} Running text...                  \\
appendix                                              & \code{======= Appendix: heading =======} (7 \code{=}) \\
appendix                                              & \code{===== Appendix: heading =====} (5 \code{=})     \\
exercise                                              & \code{======= Exercise: heading =======} (7 \code{=}) \\
exercise                                              & \code{===== Exercise: heading =====} (5 \code{=})     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with \code{__Abstract.__} or
\code{__Summary.__} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more \code{=} signs of the next heading.

The \code{Exercise:} keyword kan be substituted by \code{Problem:} or \code{Project:}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

\subsection{Inline Formatting}

Words surrounded by \code{*} are emphasized: \code{*emphasized words*} becomes
\emph{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: \code{_boldface_} becomes \textbf{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text
\bccq
`color{red}{two red words}`
\eccq
becomes \textcolor{red}{two red words}.

\subsection{Lists}

There are three types of lists: \emph{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with \code{*}, \emph{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with \code{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and \emph{description} lists, where each item starts with \code{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
\bccq
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
\eccq
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

\begin{itemize}
 \item item1

 \item item2
\begin{itemize}

  \item subitem1 of item2

  \item subitem2 of item2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
 \item item3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
\begin{enumerate}

 \item subitem1 of item2

 \item subitem2 of item2

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\item item3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
And finally a description list:

\begin{description}
 \item[keyword1:] 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 \item[keyword2:] 
   followed by text on the next line

 \item[keyword3:] 
   and its description may fit on one line
\end{description}

\noindent
\subsection{Comment lines}

Lines starting with \code{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before {\LaTeX} math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats \code{rst} and
\code{sphinx} are desired.

Comment lines starting with \code{##} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
\code{# #ifdef EXTRA} and \code{# #endif} around the text. The command line
option \code{-DEXTRA} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


\subsection{Inline comments}

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
\bccq
[name: running text]
\eccq
where \code{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and \code{running text} is the comment. Here goes an example.
\shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines. }{ There must be a }
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with {\LaTeX}
output and the \code{-DTOTONOTES} option to \code{ptex2tex} or \code{doconce ptex2tex},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the \code{todonotes} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
\bsys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
\esys
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
\bsys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
\esys

\subsection{Verbatim/Computer Code}

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
\bccq
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
\eccq
resulting in Some sentence with \code{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between \code{!bc xxx} and \code{!ec} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification \code{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for \code{xxx} are
nothing, \code{cod} for a code snippet, \code{pro} for a complete program,
\code{sys} for a terminal session, \code{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
\code{Xpro} or \code{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming \code{X}, where \code{X} may be \code{py} for Python,
\code{cy} for Cython, \code{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
\code{f} for Fortran, \code{c} for C, \code{cpp} for C++, \code{m} for MATLAB,
\code{pl} for Perl. For output in \code{latex} one can let \code{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the \code{ptex2tex} configuration file
(\code{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For \code{sphinx} output one can insert a comment
\bccq
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\eccq
that maps environments (\code{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what \code{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The \code{xxx} specifier has only effect for \code{latex} and
\code{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

\bcod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
\ecod

% When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
% ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
\bccq
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
\eccq
The \code{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file \code{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the \emph{regular
expression} \code{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the \emph{regular expression} \code{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside \code{!bc shpro}
and \code{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become \code{!bc shcod} and \code{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension \code{.X}, the environment
becomes \code{!bc Xpro} or \code{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (\code{Xcod} and \code{Xpro}) are only active
for \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex}, html`, and \code{sphinx} outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes \code{shpro} even if we copy a part
of the file (here from \code{name=} until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 \item Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard {\LaTeX} syntax. The output formats \code{html}, \code{sphinx}, \code{latex},
pdflatex`, \code{pandoc}, and \code{mwiki} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw {\LaTeX} code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
{\LaTeX} way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than \code{sphinx},
\code{latex}, and \code{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
\bccq
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
\eccq
That is, the {\LaTeX} expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of {\LaTeX} mathematics are written within
\code{!bt}
and
\code{!et} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
\eccq

This {\LaTeX} code gets rendered as

\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
Here is a single equation:

\bccq
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
\eccq
which results in

\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any {\LaTeX} syntax is accepted, but if output in the \code{sphinx}, \code{pandoc},
\code{mwiki}, \code{html}, or \code{ipynb} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use only the equation environments \code{\[}, \code{\]},
    \code{equation}, \code{equation*}, \code{align}, and \code{align*}.

  \item MediaWiki (\code{mwiki}) does not support references to equations.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
(Doconce performs extensions to \code{sphinx} and other formats such that
labels in \code{align} environments work well.)


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Notice.]
{\LaTeX} supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as \code{sphinx}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard {\LaTeX} and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically \code{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
include special code for \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced {\LaTeX} features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{LaTeX Newcommands.}
The author can define \code{newcommand} statements in files with names
\code{newcommands*.tex}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other {\LaTeX} constructions are only understood by {\LaTeX} itself).
The convention is that \code{newcommands_keep.tex}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in \code{newcommands_replace.tex} will be replaced by their full
{\LaTeX} code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without {\LaTeX} support. For \code{html}, \code{sphinx}, \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex},
\code{mwiki}, \code{ipynb}, and \code{pandoc}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

\bccq
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
\eccq

\subsection{Figures and Movies}

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
\bccq
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

\eccq
Note three important syntax details:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 \item no comments between \code{width}, \code{height}, and \code{frac} and no spaces
    around the \code{=} characters,

 \item all of the command must appear on a single line,

 \item there must be a blank line after the command.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or {\LaTeX} formats). The \code{width}
and \code{height} parameters affect HTML formats (\code{html}, \code{rst}, \code{sphinx}),
while \code{frac} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
\bsys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
\esys
This command applies \code{montage} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in \code{html} and \code{sphinx} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

\bccq
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

\eccq
The latter results in


\begin{doconce:movie}
\refstepcounter{doconce:movie:counter}
\begin{center}\href{{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}{\nolinkurl{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}\end{center}

\begin{center}  % movie caption
Movie \arabic{doconce:movie:counter}: Vimeo movie.
\end{center}

\subsection{Tables}

The table in Section~\ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
\bccq
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
\eccq

Note that

\begin{itemize}
 \item Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 \item If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in {\LaTeX}.

 \item Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The command-line option \code{--tables2csv} (to \code{doconce format})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file \code{table_X.csv},
where \code{X} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

\subsection{Labels and References}

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from {\LaTeX} with a very similar syntax. As in {\LaTeX}, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
\bccq
label{name}
\eccq
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose \code{name}
as some hierarchical name, say \code{a:b:c}, where \code{a} and \code{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
\code{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label \code{name} is written as
\bccq
ref{name}
\eccq
again with no backslash before \code{ref}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


\subsection{Citations and Bibliography}

Single citations are written as
\bccq
cite{name}
\eccq
where \code{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, {\LaTeX} writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have \code{name} on the form
\code{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, \code{Author_YYYY}, or \code{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
\code{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
\bccq
cite{name1,name2,name3}
\eccq

The bibliography is specified by a line \code{BIBFILE: papers.pub},
where \code{papers.pub} is a publication database in the
\href{{https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish}}{Publish} format.
\textsc{Bib}\negthinspace{\TeX} \code{.bib} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than {\LaTeX}).

\subsection{Generalized Citations}

There is a \emph{generalized referencing} feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with \code{ref} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
\bccq
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
\eccq
The output from a generalized reference is the text \code{internal} if all
\code{ref{label}} references in \code{internal} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
\code{latex} or \code{pdflatex} one assumes that the references in \code{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line \code{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is \code{internal cite} and the
{\LaTeX} package \code{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
\code{external} text will be the output.

\subsection{Index of Keywords}

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
\bccq
index{name}
\eccq
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the \code{latex},
\code{pdflatex}, \code{rst}, and \code{sphinx} formats.

\subsection{Capabilities of The Program \protect\code{doconce} }

The \code{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a \code{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

\eshpro

\subsection{Exercises}

Doconce supports \emph{Exercise}, \emph{Problem}, \emph{Project}, and \emph{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain \emph{elements}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  \item a label (optional)

  \item a solution file (optional)

  \item name of file with a student solution (optional)

  \item main exercise text (required)

  \item a short answer (optional)

  \item a full solution (optional)

  \item one or more hints (optional)

  \item one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
\bccq
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
\eccq
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

\bccq
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\eccq
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

\bccq
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

\eccq
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments \code{--without_answers} and \code{--without_solutions}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


\subsection{Environments}

Doconce environments start with \code{!benvirname} and end with \code{!eenvirname},
where \code{envirname} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \code{c}: computer code (or verbatim text)

 \item \code{t}: math blocks with {\LaTeX} syntax

 \item \code{subex}: sub-exercise

 \item \code{ans}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \code{sol}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \code{quote}: indented text

 \item \code{notice}, \code{summary}, \code{warning}, \code{question}, \code{hint}: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 \item \code{pop}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 \item \code{slidecell}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Preprocessing}

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either \code{preprocess} and/or
\code{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The \code{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command \code{doconce format} first runs \code{preprocess} and then \code{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing \code{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

\bccq
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
\eccq

With the \code{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/}}{example document} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize \code{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the \code{doc/src/make.sh} script).

Doconce Quick Reference
-----------------------

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :depth: 2



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`_
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==========================================  ==========================================

==========================================  ==========================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.

exercise                                         ``======= Exercise: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
exercise                                         ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
===============================================  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. Here goes an example.
(**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.)
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the ``-DTOTONOTES`` option to ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the ``todonotes`` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, html`, and ``sphinx`` outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes ``shpro`` even if we copy a part
of the file (here from ``name=`` until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
   Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
   PDF document.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        




Tables
------

The table in the section `Section Types`_ was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`_ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
``label`_` references in ``internal`` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

Doconce Quick Reference
-----------------------

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`_
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==========================================  ==========================================

==========================================  ==========================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

.. code-block:: text


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

.. code-block:: text


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.


.. _quick:sections:

Section Types
-------------

===============================================  ===============================================  
                  Section type                                        Syntax                      
===============================================  ===============================================  
chapter                                          ``========= Heading ========`` (9 ``=``)         
section                                          ``======= Heading =======``    (7 ``=``)         
subsection                                       ``===== Heading =====``        (5 ``=``)         
subsubsection                                    ``=== Heading ===``            (3 ``=``)         
paragraph                                        ``__Heading.__``               (2 ``_``)         
abstract                                         ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...                
appendix                                         ``======= Appendix: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
appendix                                         ``===== Appendix: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
exercise                                         ``======= Exercise: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
exercise                                         ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
===============================================  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text

.. code-block:: text


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

.. code-block:: text


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

.. code-block:: text


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. Here goes an example.
(**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.)
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the ``-DTOTONOTES`` option to ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the ``todonotes`` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

.. code-block:: console

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by

.. code-block:: console

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

.. code-block:: text


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment

.. code-block:: text


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file:

.. code-block:: text


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, html`, and ``sphinx`` outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes ``shpro`` even if we copy a part
of the file (here from ``name=`` until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
:math:`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

.. code-block:: text


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as


.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        

Here is a single equation:


.. code-block:: text


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in


.. math::
         \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
   Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
   PDF document.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:


.. code-block:: text


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

.. code-block:: text


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

.. code-block:: console

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is


.. code-block:: text


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        




Tables
------

The table in the section :ref:`quick:sections` was written with this
syntax:

.. code-block:: text


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

.. code-block:: text


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as

.. code-block:: text


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as

.. code-block:: text


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

.. code-block:: text


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`_ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

.. code-block:: text


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
`:ref:`label`` references in ``internal`` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

.. code-block:: text


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

.. code-block:: text


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads


.. code-block:: text


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:


.. code-block:: text


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}

        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


.. code-block:: text


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"

************** File: quickref.gwiki *****************
#summary Doconce Quick Reference

By *Hans Petter Langtangen*
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<wiki: toc max_depth="2" />



*WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!*

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 ||                _Emacs key_                  ||                  _Action_                   ||
 ||  Ctrl+c f                                   ||  figure                                     ||
 ||  Ctrl+c v                                   ||  movie/video                                ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h1                                  ||  heading level 1 (section/h1)               ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h2                                  ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)            ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h3                                  ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)            ||
 ||  Ctrl+c hp                                  ||  heading for paragraph                      ||
 ||  Ctrl+c me                                  ||  math environment: `!bt` equation `!et`     ||

 ||  Ctrl+c table3                              ||  table with 3 columns                       ||
 ||  Ctrl+c table4                              ||  table with 4 columns                       ||

 ||  Ctrl+c slide                               ||  slide outline                              ||
 ||  Ctrl+c help                                ||  print this table                           ||


==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


==== Section Types ====


 ||                  _Section type_                  ||                     _Syntax_                     ||
 ||  chapter                                         ||  `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)            ||
 ||  section                                         ||  `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsection                                      ||  `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsubsection                                   ||  `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)            ||
 ||  paragraph                                       ||  `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)            ||
 ||  abstract                                        ||  `__Abstract.__` Running text...                 ||
 ||  appendix                                        ||  `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  appendix                                        ||  `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||
 ||  exercise                                        ||  `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  exercise                                        ||  `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes *boldface*. Colored words
are also possible: the text
{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 # subitem1 of item2
 # subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
}}}
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes `shpro` even if we copy a part
of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces    around the `=` characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. `http://vimeo.com/55562330`: load [movie_player1.html `movie_player1.html`] into a browser


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized Citations ====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`label` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` ====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

}}}

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

************** File: quickref.mwiki *****************
#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Doconce Quick Reference

By '''Hans Petter Langtangen'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

__TOC__



'''WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!'''

''Mission.''
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code ''once, in one place'' and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                          Emacs key                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                            Action                            </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f                                                        </td> <td align="left">   figure                                                          </td> </tr>

</table>
==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</syntaxhighlight>
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
</syntaxhighlight>
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.


==== Section Types ====

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                            Section type                           </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                               Syntax                              </b></td> </tr>

</table>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
''emphasized words''. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes '''boldface'''. Colored words
are also possible: the text
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
`color{red}{two red words}`
</syntaxhighlight>
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: ''bullet lists'', where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, ''enumeration lists'', where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and ''description'' lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</syntaxhighlight>
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


<ul>
 <li> item1
 <li> item2

<ul>
  <li><li> subitem1 of item2
  <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ul>

 <li> item3
</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

<ol>
 <li><li> subitem1 of item2
 <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ol>

<li> item3
</ol>

And finally a description list:


<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[name: running text]
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the <code>-DTOTONOTES</code> option to <code>ptex2tex</code> or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the <code>todonotes</code> package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</syntaxhighlight>
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</syntaxhighlight>
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</syntaxhighlight>
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
</syntaxhighlight>
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the ''regular
expression'' <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including the line
matching the ''regular expression'' <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active
for <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, html`, and <code>sphinx</code> outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes <code>shpro</code> even if we copy a part
of the file (here from <code>name=</code> until the end of the file).

Important warnings:


<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
</ul>

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
<math>Ax=b</math>. To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</syntaxhighlight>
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</syntaxhighlight>

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
</math>
Here is a single equation:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</syntaxhighlight>
which results in

:<math>
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
</math>

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>,
    <code>equation</code>, <code>equation*</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>align*</code>.
  <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.
</ul>

(Doconce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Notice.''' LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code>, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.
}}



''LaTeX Newcommands.''
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</syntaxhighlight>
Note three important syntax details:


<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</syntaxhighlight>
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</syntaxhighlight>
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. <code>http://vimeo.com/55562330</code>: load [movie_player1.html <code>movie_player1.html</code>] into a browser


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
</syntaxhighlight>

Note that


<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
label{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, say <code>a:b:c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<code>c</code> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name1,name2,name3}
</syntaxhighlight>

The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized Citations ====

There is a ''generalized referencing'' feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
</syntaxhighlight>
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
<code>label</code> references in <code>internal</code> are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
index{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code> ====

The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports ''Exercise'', ''Problem'', ''Project'', and ''Example''.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain ''elements'':


<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  <li> a label (optional)
  <li> a solution file (optional)
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)
  <li> main exercise text (required)
  <li> a short answer (optional)
  <li> a full solution (optional)
  <li> one or more hints (optional)
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</syntaxhighlight>
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</syntaxhighlight>
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</syntaxhighlight>
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

Doconce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
</ul>

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</syntaxhighlight>

With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

#summary Doconce Quick Reference
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By **Hans Petter Langtangen**
=== Jan 32, 2100 ===

<<TableOfContents>>



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

//Mission.// Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code //once, in one place// and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's {{{blogger.com}}}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

== Supported Formats ==

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}})
 * HTML (format {{{html}}})
 * reStructuredText (format {{{rst}}})
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format {{{plain}}})
 * Sphinx (format {{{sphinx}}})
 * IPython notebook (format {{{ipynb}}})
 * MediaWiki (format {{{mwiki}}})
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format {{{pandoc}}})
 * Googlecode wiki (format {{{gwiki}}})
 * Creoloe wiki (format {{{cwiki}}})
 * Epydoc (format {{{epydoc}}})
 * StructuredText (format {{{st}}})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, and {{{html}}}; and to a slightly
less extent {{{mwiki}}} and {{{pandoc}}}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


== Emacs syntax support ==

The file [[https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el|.doconce-mode.el]]
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
{{{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")}}} to the {{{.emacs}}} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 | =Emacs key                                          | =Action                                             |
 |  Ctrl+c f                                           |  figure                                             |
 |  Ctrl+c v                                           |  movie/video                                        |

 |  Ctrl+c h2                                          |  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)                    |
 |  Ctrl+c h3                                          |  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)                    |
 |  Ctrl+c hp                                          |  heading for paragraph                              |
 |  Ctrl+c me                                          |  math environment: {{{!bt}}} equation {{{!et}}}     |
 |  Ctrl+c ma                                          |  math environment: {{{!bt}}} align {{{!et}}}        |
 |  Ctrl+c ce                                          |  code environment: {{{!bc}}} code {{{!ec}}}         |
 |  Ctrl+c cf                                          |  code from file: {{{@@@CODE}}}                      |
 |  Ctrl+c table2                                      |  table with 2 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c table3                                      |  table with 3 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c table4                                      |  table with 4 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c exer                                        |  exercise outline                                   |
 |  Ctrl+c slide                                       |  slide outline                                      |
 |  Ctrl+c help                                        |  print this table                                   |


== Title, Authors, and Date ==

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the {{{&}}} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword {{{and}}} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from {{{today}}} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., {{{Jan 32, 2100}}}.

The table of contents is removed by writing {{{TOC: off}}}.


== Section Types ==



 | =Section type                                            | =Syntax                                                  |
 |  chapter                                                 |  {{{========= Heading ========}}} (9 {{{=}}})            |
 |  section                                                 |  {{{======= Heading =======}}}    (7 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsection                                              |  {{{===== Heading =====}}}        (5 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsubsection                                           |  {{{=== Heading ===}}}            (3 {{{=}}})            |
 |  paragraph                                               |  {{{__Heading.__}}}               (2 {{{_}}})            |
 |  abstract                                                |  {{{__Abstract.__}}} Running text...                     |
 |  appendix                                                |  {{{======= Appendix: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  appendix                                                |  {{{===== Appendix: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |
 |  exercise                                                |  {{{======= Exercise: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  exercise                                                |  {{{===== Exercise: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with {{{__Abstract.__}}} or
{{{__Summary.__}}} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more {{{=}}} signs of the next heading.

The {{{Exercise:}}} keyword kan be substituted by {{{Problem:}}} or {{{Project:}}}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

== Inline Formatting ==

Words surrounded by {{{*}}} are emphasized: {{{*emphasized words*}}} becomes
//emphasized words//. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: {{{_boldface_}}} becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text
{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

== Lists ==

There are three types of lists: //bullet lists//, where each item starts
with {{{*}}}, //enumeration lists//, where each item starts with {{{o}}} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and //description// lists, where each item starts with {{{-}}} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  ** subitem1 of item2
  //* subitem2 of item2


 // item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 ## subitem1 of item2
 ## subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

== Comment lines ==

Lines starting with {{{#}}} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats {{{rst}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} are desired.

Comment lines starting with {{{##}}} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
{{{# #ifdef EXTRA}}} and {{{# #endif}}} around the text. The command line
option {{{-DEXTRA}}} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


== Inline comments ==

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where {{{name}}} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and {{{running text}}} is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the {{{-DTOTONOTES}}} option to {{{ptex2tex}}} or {{{doconce ptex2tex}}},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the {{{todonotes}}} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

== Verbatim/Computer Code ==

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with {{{words in verbatim style}}}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between {{{!bc xxx}}} and {{{!ec}}} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification {{{xxx}}} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for {{{xxx}}} are
nothing, {{{cod}}} for a code snippet, {{{pro}}} for a complete program,
{{{sys}}} for a terminal session, {{{dat}}} for a data file (or output from a
program),
{{{Xpro}}} or {{{Xcod}}} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming {{{X}}}, where {{{X}}} may be {{{py}}} for Python,
{{{cy}}} for Cython, {{{sh}}} for Bash or other Unix shells,
{{{f}}} for Fortran, {{{c}}} for C, {{{cpp}}} for C++, {{{m}}} for MATLAB,
{{{pl}}} for Perl. For output in {{{latex}}} one can let {{{xxx}}} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the {{{ptex2tex}}} configuration file
({{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}). For {{{sphinx}}} output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments ({{{xxx}}}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what {{{sphinx}}} applies to typeset computer code).

The {{{xxx}}} specifier has only effect for {{{latex}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
}}}
The {{{@@@CODE}}} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file {{{doconce_program.sh}}}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the //regular
expression// {{{doconce clean}}} up to, but not including the line
matching the //regular expression// {{{^doconce split_rst}}}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside {{{!bc shpro}}}
and {{{!ec}}} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become {{{!bc shcod}}} and {{{!ec}}} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension {{{.X}}}, the environment
becomes {{{!bc Xpro}}} or {{{!bc Xcod}}} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ({{{Xcod}}} and {{{Xpro}}}) are only active
for {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, html`, and {{{sphinx}}} outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes {{{shpro}}} even if we copy a part
of the file (here from {{{name=}}} until the end of the file).

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}},
pdflatex`, {{{pandoc}}}, and {{{mwiki}}} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
{{{Ax=b}}}. To help increase readability in other formats than {{{sphinx}}},
{{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
{{{!bt}}}
and
{{{!et}}} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the {{{sphinx}}}, {{{pandoc}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{html}}}, or {{{ipynb}}} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


  * Use only the equation environments {{{\[}}}, {{{\]}}},    {{{equation}}}, {{{equation*}}}, {{{align}}}, and {{{align*}}}.
  * MediaWiki ({{{mwiki}}}) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to {{{sphinx}}} and other formats such that
labels in {{{align}}} environments work well.)

//Notice.// 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as {{{sphinx}}}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically {{{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}}}) to
include special code for {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



//LaTeX Newcommands.// The author can define {{{newcommand}}} statements in files with names
{{{newcommands*.tex}}}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in {{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{ipynb}}}, and {{{pandoc}}}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


== Hyperlinks ==

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

== Figures and Movies ==

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between {{{width}}}, {{{height}}}, and {{{frac}}} and no spaces    around the {{{=}}} characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The {{{width}}}
and {{{height}}} parameters affect HTML formats ({{{html}}}, {{{rst}}}, {{{sphinx}}}),
while {{{frac}}} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies {{{montage}}} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in {{{html}}} and {{{sphinx}}} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. {{{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}}: load [[movie_player1.html|{{{movie_player1.html}}}]] into a browser


== Tables ==

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option {{{--tables2csv}}} (to {{{doconce format}}})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file {{{table_X.csv}}},
where {{{X}}} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

== Labels and References ==

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose {{{name}}}
as some hierarchical name, say {{{a:b:c}}}, where {{{a}}} and {{{b}}} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
{{{c}}} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label {{{name}}} is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before {{{ref}}}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


== Citations and Bibliography ==

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where {{{name}}} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have {{{name}}} on the form
{{{Author1_Author2_YYYY}}}, {{{Author_YYYY}}}, or {{{Author1_etal_YYYY}}}, where
{{{YYYY}}} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line {{{BIBFILE: papers.pub}}},
where {{{papers.pub}}} is a publication database in the
[[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish|Publish]] format.
BibTeX {{{.bib}}} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

== Generalized Citations ==

There is a //generalized referencing// feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with {{{ref}}} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is
{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text {{{internal}}} if all
{{{label}}} references in {{{internal}}} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
{{{latex}}} or {{{pdflatex}}} one assumes that the references in {{{internal}}}
are to external documents declared by a comment line {{{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc}}} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is {{{internal cite}}} and the
LaTeX package {{{xr}}} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
{{{external}}} text will be the output.

== Index of Keywords ==

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the {{{latex}}},
{{{pdflatex}}}, {{{rst}}}, and {{{sphinx}}} formats.

== Capabilities of The Program {{{doconce}}} ==

The {{{doconce}}} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a {{{.do.txt}}} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

== Exercises ==

Doconce supports //Exercise//, //Problem//, //Project//, and //Example//.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain //elements//:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments {{{--without_answers}}} and {{{--without_solutions}}}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


== Environments ==

Doconce environments start with {{{!benvirname}}} and end with {{{!eenvirname}}},
where {{{envirname}}} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * {{{c}}}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * {{{t}}}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * {{{subex}}}: sub-exercise
 * {{{ans}}}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{sol}}}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{quote}}}: indented text
 * {{{notice}}}, {{{summary}}}, {{{warning}}}, {{{question}}}, {{{hint}}}: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * {{{pop}}}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * {{{slidecell}}}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

== Preprocessing ==

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either {{{preprocess}}} and/or
{{{mako}}}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The {{{mako}}} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command {{{doconce format}}} first runs {{{preprocess}}} and then {{{mako}}}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing {{{preprocess}}} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the {{{mako}}} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [[http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/|example document]] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize {{{mako}}} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the {{{doc/src/make.sh}}} script).

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"



************** File: quickref.st *****************
TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's 'blogger.com', Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format 'latex' and 'pdflatex')
 - HTML (format 'html')
 - reStructuredText (format 'rst')
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format 'plain')
 - Sphinx (format 'sphinx')
 - IPython notebook (format 'ipynb')
 - MediaWiki (format 'mwiki')
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format 'pandoc')
 - Googlecode wiki (format 'gwiki')
 - Creoloe wiki (format 'cwiki')
 - Epydoc (format 'epydoc')
 - StructuredText (format 'st')

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', and 'html'; and to a slightly
less extent 'mwiki' and 'pandoc'. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support

The file "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el":.doconce-mode.el
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
'(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")' to the '.emacs' file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

======================================  ======================================  
              Emacs key                                 Action

======================================  ======================================  

Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the '&' keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword 'and' works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from 'today' if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., 'Jan 32, 2100'.

The table of contents is removed by writing 'TOC: off'.


Section Types

===========================================  ===========================================  
                Section type                                    Syntax                    
===========================================  ===========================================  
chapter                                      '========= Heading ========' (9 '=')         
section                                      '======= Heading ======='    (7 '=')         
subsection                                   '===== Heading ====='        (5 '=')         
subsubsection                                '=== Heading ==='            (3 '=')         
paragraph                                    '__Heading.__'               (2 '_')         
abstract                                     '__Abstract.__' Running text...              
appendix                                     '======= Appendix: heading =======' (7 '=')  
appendix                                     '===== Appendix: heading =====' (5 '=')      
exercise                                     '======= Exercise: heading =======' (7 '=')  
exercise                                     '===== Exercise: heading =====' (5 '=')      
===========================================  ===========================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with '__Abstract.__' or
'__Summary.__' at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more '=' signs of the next heading.

The 'Exercise:' keyword kan be substituted by 'Problem:' or 'Project:'.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by '*' are emphasized: '*emphasized words*' becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: '_boldface_' becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with '*', *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with 'o' and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with '-' followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: --  
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 keyword2: --  
   followed by text on the next line
 keyword3: --  
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines

Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats 'rst' and
'sphinx' are desired.

Comment lines starting with '##' are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
'# #ifdef EXTRA' and '# #endif' around the text. The command line
option '-DEXTRA' will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where 'name' is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and 'running text' is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the '-DTOTONOTES' option to 'ptex2tex' or 'doconce ptex2tex',
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the 'todonotes' package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with 'words in verbatim style'.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between '!bc xxx' and '!ec' directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification 'xxx' indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for 'xxx' are
nothing, 'cod' for a code snippet, 'pro' for a complete program,
'sys' for a terminal session, 'dat' for a data file (or output from a
program),
'Xpro' or 'Xcod' for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming 'X', where 'X' may be 'py' for Python,
'cy' for Cython, 'sh' for Bash or other Unix shells,
'f' for Fortran, 'c' for C, 'cpp' for C++, 'm' for MATLAB,
'pl' for Perl. For output in 'latex' one can let 'xxx' reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the 'ptex2tex' configuration file
('.ptex2tex.cfg'). For 'sphinx' output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments ('xxx') onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what 'sphinx' applies to typeset computer code).

The 'xxx' specifier has only effect for 'latex' and
'sphinx' output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The '@@@CODE' identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file 'doconce_program.sh'.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* 'doconce clean' up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* '^doconce split_rst'.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside '!bc shpro'
and '!ec' directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become '!bc shcod' and '!ec' when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension '.X', the environment
becomes '!bc Xpro' or '!bc Xcod' for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ('Xcod' and 'Xpro') are only active
for 'latex', 'pdflatex', html`, and 'sphinx' outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes 'shpro' even if we copy a part
of the file (here from 'name=' until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex',
pdflatex`, 'pandoc', and 'mwiki' work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than 'sphinx',
'latex', and 'pdflatex', inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
'!bt'
and
'!et' (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the 'sphinx', 'pandoc',
'mwiki', 'html', or 'ipynb' formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  - Use only the equation environments '\[', '\]',
    'equation', 'equation*', 'align', and 'align*'.
  - MediaWiki ('mwiki') does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to 'sphinx' and other formats such that
labels in 'align' environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as 'sphinx', makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically 'if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")') to
include special code for 'latex' and 'pdflatex' output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define 'newcommand' statements in files with names
'newcommands*.tex'. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that 'newcommands_keep.tex'
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in 'newcommands_replace.tex' will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex', 'pdflatex',
'mwiki', 'ipynb', and 'pandoc', the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between 'width', 'height', and 'frac' and no spaces
    around the '=' characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The 'width'
and 'height' parameters affect HTML formats ('html', 'rst', 'sphinx'),
while 'frac' is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the 'latex' and 'pdflatex' formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies 'montage' or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in 'html' and 'sphinx' documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. 'http://vimeo.com/55562330': load movie_player1.html:'movie_player1.html' into a browser


Tables

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option '--tables2csv' (to 'doconce format')
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file 'table_X.csv',
where 'X' is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose 'name'
as some hierarchical name, say 'a:b:c', where 'a' and 'b' indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
'c' is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label 'name' is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before 'ref'.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where 'name' is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have 'name' on the form
'Author1_Author2_YYYY', 'Author_YYYY', or 'Author1_etal_YYYY', where
'YYYY' is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line 'BIBFILE: papers.pub',
where 'papers.pub' is a publication database in the
"https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish":Publish format.
BibTeX '.bib' files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with 'ref' to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text 'internal' if all
'ref{label}' references in 'internal' are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
'latex' or 'pdflatex' one assumes that the references in 'internal'
are to external documents declared by a comment line '#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc' (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is 'internal cite' and the
LaTeX package 'xr' is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
'external' text will be the output.

Index of Keywords

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the 'latex',
'pdflatex', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats.

Capabilities of The Program 'doconce'

The 'doconce' program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a '.do.txt' file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments '--without_answers' and '--without_solutions'
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments

Doconce environments start with '!benvirname' and end with '!eenvirname',
where 'envirname' is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - 'c': computer code (or verbatim text)
 - 't': math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - 'subex': sub-exercise
 - 'ans': short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'sol': full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'quote': indented text
 - 'notice', 'summary', 'warning', 'question', 'hint': admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - 'pop': text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - 'slidecell': indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either 'preprocess' and/or
'mako'. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The 'mako' preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command 'doconce format' first runs 'preprocess' and then 'mako'.
Here is a typical example on utilizing 'preprocess' to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the 'mako' preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/":example document contains
some illustrations on how to utilize 'mako' (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the 'doc/src/make.sh' script).

 - Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"

************** File: quickref.epytext *****************
TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
B{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

I{Mission.} Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code I{once, in one place} and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's C{blogger.com}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format C{latex} and C{pdflatex})
 - HTML (format C{html})
 - reStructuredText (format C{rst})
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format C{plain})
 - Sphinx (format C{sphinx})
 - IPython notebook (format C{ipynb})
 - MediaWiki (format C{mwiki})
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format C{pandoc})
 - Googlecode wiki (format C{gwiki})
 - Creoloe wiki (format C{cwiki})
 - Epydoc (format C{epydoc})
 - StructuredText (format C{st})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{sphinx}, and C{html}; and to a slightly
less extent C{mwiki} and C{pandoc}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file U{.doconce-mode.el<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>}
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
C{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")} to the C{.emacs} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

========================================  ========================================  
               Emacs key                                   Action

========================================  ========================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the C{&} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword C{and} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from C{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., C{Jan 32, 2100}.

The table of contents is removed by writing C{TOC: off}.


Section Types
-------------

=============================================  =============================================  
                 Section type                                      Syntax                     
=============================================  =============================================  
chapter                                        C{========= Heading ========} (9 C{=})         
section                                        C{======= Heading =======}    (7 C{=})         
subsection                                     C{===== Heading =====}        (5 C{=})         
subsubsection                                  C{=== Heading ===}            (3 C{=})         
paragraph                                      C{__Heading.__}               (2 C{_})         
abstract                                       C{__Abstract.__} Running text...               
appendix                                       C{======= Appendix: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
appendix                                       C{===== Appendix: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
exercise                                       C{======= Exercise: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
exercise                                       C{===== Exercise: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
=============================================  =============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with C{__Abstract.__} or
C{__Summary.__} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more C{=} signs of the next heading.

The C{Exercise:} keyword kan be substituted by C{Problem:} or C{Project:}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by C{*} are emphasized: C{*emphasized words*} becomes
I{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: C{_boldface_} becomes B{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: I{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with C{*}, I{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with C{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and I{description} lists, where each item starts with C{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with C{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats C{rst} and
C{sphinx} are desired.

Comment lines starting with C{##} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
C{# #ifdef EXTRA} and C{# #endif} around the text. The command line
option C{-DEXTRA} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where C{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and C{running text} is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the C{-DTOTONOTES} option to C{ptex2tex} or C{doconce ptex2tex},
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the C{todonotes} package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with C{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between C{!bc xxx} and C{!ec} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification C{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for C{xxx} are
nothing, C{cod} for a code snippet, C{pro} for a complete program,
C{sys} for a terminal session, C{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
C{Xpro} or C{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming C{X}, where C{X} may be C{py} for Python,
C{cy} for Cython, C{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
C{f} for Fortran, C{c} for C, C{cpp} for C++, C{m} for MATLAB,
C{pl} for Perl. For output in C{latex} one can let C{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the C{ptex2tex} configuration file
(C{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For C{sphinx} output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (C{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what C{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The C{xxx} specifier has only effect for C{latex} and
C{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The C{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file C{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the I{regular
expression} C{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the I{regular expression} C{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside C{!bc shpro}
and C{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become C{!bc shcod} and C{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension C{.X}, the environment
becomes C{!bc Xpro} or C{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (C{Xcod} and C{Xpro}) are only active
for C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, html`, and C{sphinx} outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes C{shpro} even if we copy a part
of the file (here from C{name=} until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex},
pdflatex`, C{pandoc}, and C{mwiki} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
M{Ax=b}. To help increase readability in other formats than C{sphinx},
C{latex}, and C{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
C{!bt}
and
C{!et} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



This LaTeX code gets rendered as::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Here is a single equation::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


which results in::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the C{sphinx}, C{pandoc},
C{mwiki}, C{html}, or C{ipynb} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  - Use only the equation environments C{\[}, C{\]},
    C{equation}, C{equation*}, C{align}, and C{align*}.
  - MediaWiki (C{mwiki}) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to C{sphinx} and other formats such that
labels in C{align} environments work well.)

I{Notice.} 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as C{sphinx}, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically C{if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
include special code for C{latex} and C{pdflatex} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



I{LaTeX Newcommands.} The author can define C{newcommand} statements in files with names
C{newcommands*.tex}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that C{newcommands_keep.tex}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in C{newcommands_replace.tex} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex}, C{pdflatex},
C{mwiki}, C{ipynb}, and C{pandoc}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between C{width}, C{height}, and C{frac} and no spaces
    around the C{=} characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The C{width}
and C{height} parameters affect HTML formats (C{html}, C{rst}, C{sphinx}),
while C{frac} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the C{latex} and C{pdflatex} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies C{montage} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in C{html} and C{sphinx} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. C{http://vimeo.com/55562330}: load U{C{movie_player1.html}<movie_player1.html>} into a browser


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option C{--tables2csv} (to C{doconce format})
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file C{table_X.csv},
where C{X} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose C{name}
as some hierarchical name, say C{a:b:c}, where C{a} and C{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
C{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label C{name} is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before C{ref}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where C{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have C{name} on the form
C{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, C{Author_YYYY}, or C{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
C{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line C{BIBFILE: papers.pub},
where C{papers.pub} is a publication database in the
U{Publish<https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>} format.
BibTeX C{.bib} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a I{generalized referencing} feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with C{ref} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text C{internal} if all
C{ref{label}} references in C{internal} are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
C{latex} or C{pdflatex} one assumes that the references in C{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line C{#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is C{internal cite} and the
LaTeX package C{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
C{external} text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the C{latex},
C{pdflatex}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats.

Capabilities of The Program C{doconce}
--------------------------------------

The C{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a C{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports I{Exercise}, I{Problem}, I{Project}, and I{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain I{elements}:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments C{--without_answers} and C{--without_solutions}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with C{!benvirname} and end with C{!eenvirname},
where C{envirname} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - C{c}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 - C{t}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - C{subex}: sub-exercise
 - C{ans}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{sol}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{quote}: indented text
 - C{notice}, C{summary}, C{warning}, C{question}, C{hint}: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - C{pop}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - C{slidecell}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either C{preprocess} and/or
C{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The C{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command C{doconce format} first runs C{preprocess} and then C{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing C{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



With the C{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An U{example document<http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize C{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the C{doc/src/make.sh} script).

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's blogger.com, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format latex and pdflatex)

 * HTML (format html)

 * reStructuredText (format rst)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format plain)

 * Sphinx (format sphinx)

 * IPython notebook (format ipynb)

 * MediaWiki (format mwiki)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format pandoc)

 * Googlecode wiki (format gwiki)

 * Creoloe wiki (format cwiki)

 * Epydoc (format epydoc)

 * StructuredText (format st)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are latex, pdflatex, sphinx, and html; and to a slightly
less extent mwiki and pandoc. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file .doconce-mode.el (https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el") to the .emacs file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

==================================  ==================================  
            Emacs key                             Action

Ctrl+c help                         print this table                    
==================================  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the & keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword and works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from today if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., Jan 32, 2100.

The table of contents is removed by writing TOC: off.


Section Types
-------------

=======================================  =======================================  
              Section type                                Syntax                  
=======================================  =======================================  
chapter                                  ========= Heading ======== (9 =)         
section                                  ======= Heading =======    (7 =)         
subsection                               ===== Heading =====        (5 =)         
subsubsection                            === Heading ===            (3 =)         
paragraph                                __Heading.__               (2 _)         
abstract                                 __Abstract.__ Running text...            
appendix                                 ======= Appendix: heading ======= (7 =)  
appendix                                 ===== Appendix: heading ===== (5 =)      
exercise                                 ======= Exercise: heading ======= (7 =)  
exercise                                 ===== Exercise: heading ===== (5 =)      
=======================================  =======================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with __Abstract.__ or
*Summary.* at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more = signs of the next heading.

The Exercise: keyword kan be substituted by Problem: or Project:.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by * are emphasized: *emphasized words* becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: _boldface_ becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text::


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with *, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with o and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with - followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with # are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats rst and
sphinx are desired.

Comment lines starting with ## are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
# #ifdef EXTRA and # #endif around the text. The command line
option -DEXTRA will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where name is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and running text is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the -DTOTONOTES option to ptex2tex or doconce ptex2tex,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the todonotes package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt


Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with words in verbatim style.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between !bc xxx and !ec directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification xxx indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for xxx are
nothing, cod for a code snippet, pro for a complete program,
sys for a terminal session, dat for a data file (or output from a
program),
Xpro or Xcod for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming X, where X may be py for Python,
cy for Cython, sh for Bash or other Unix shells,
f for Fortran, c for C, cpp for C++, m for MATLAB,
pl for Perl. For output in latex one can let xxx reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ptex2tex configuration file
(.ptex2tex.cfg). For sphinx output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (xxx) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what sphinx applies to typeset computer code).

The xxx specifier has only effect for latex and
sphinx output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)


Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The @@@CODE identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file doconce_program.sh.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* doconce clean up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ^doconce split_rst.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside !bc shpro
and !ec directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become !bc shcod and !ec when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension .X, the environment
becomes !bc Xpro or !bc Xcod for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (Xcod and Xpro) are only active
for latex, pdflatex, html`, and sphinx outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes shpro even if we copy a part
of the file (here from name= until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats html, sphinx, latex,
pdflatex`, pandoc, and mwiki work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than sphinx,
latex, and pdflatex, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
  !bt
and
  !et (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et


This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]


Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the sphinx, pandoc,
mwiki, html, or ipynb formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments \[, \],
    equation, equation*, align, and align*.

  * MediaWiki (mwiki) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to sphinx and other formats such that
labels in align environments work well.)


Notice -----------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                       |
| LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple        |
| plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.               |
| Allowing other output formats, such as sphinx, makes it necessary     |
| to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than |
| one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on    |
| the format (typically if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")) to          |
| include special code for latex and pdflatex output and more           |
| straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can   |
| also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting       |
| PDF document.                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|


*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define newcommand statements in files with names
newcommands*.tex. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that newcommands_keep.tex
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in newcommands_replace.tex will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For html, sphinx, latex, pdflatex,
mwiki, ipynb, and pandoc, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between width, height, and frac and no spaces
    around the = characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The width
and height parameters affect HTML formats (html, rst, sphinx),
while frac is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the latex and pdflatex formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::


        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies montage or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in html and sphinx documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330: load movie_player1.html (movie_player1.html) into a browser


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option --tables2csv (to doconce format)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file table_X.csv,
where X is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose name
as some hierarchical name, say a:b:c, where a and b indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
c is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label name is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ref.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where name is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have name on the form
Author1_Author2_YYYY, Author_YYYY, or Author1_etal_YYYY, where
YYYY is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line BIBFILE: papers.pub,
where papers.pub is a publication database in the
Publish (https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX .bib files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized Citations
---------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with ref to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::


        ref[internal][cite][external]
        
        # Example:
        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        Doconce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text internal if all
ref{label} references in internal are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
latex or pdflatex one assumes that the references in internal
are to external documents declared by a comment line #
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is internal cite and the
LaTeX package xr is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
external text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the latex,
pdflatex, rst, and sphinx formats.

Capabilities of The Program doconce
-----------------------------------

The doconce program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a .do.txt file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments --without_answers and --without_solutions
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


Environments
------------

Doconce environments start with !benvirname and end with !eenvirname,
where envirname is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * c: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * t: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * subex: sub-exercise

 * ans: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * sol: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * quote: indented text

 * notice, summary, warning, question, hint: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * pop: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * slidecell: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either preprocess and/or
mako. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The mako preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command doconce format first runs preprocess and then mako.
Here is a typical example on utilizing preprocess to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the mako preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An example document (http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize mako (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the doc/src/make.sh script).

Resources
---------

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"

************** File: quickref.md *****************
% Doconce Quick Reference
% Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
% Jan 32, 2100

<!-- Table of contents: Run pandoc with --toc option -->



_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

### Supported Formats

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)

 * HTML (format `html`)

 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)

 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)

 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)

 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)

 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)

 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)

 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)

 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


### Emacs syntax support

The file [.doconce-mode.el](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the Doconce source distribution gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of Doconce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


              Emacs key                                 Action

### Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


### Section Types


                Section type                                    Syntax                    
-------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------  
chapter                                      `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         
section                                      `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         
subsection                                   `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         
subsubsection                                `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         
paragraph                                    `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         
abstract                                     `__Abstract.__` Running text...              
appendix                                     `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  
appendix                                     `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      
exercise                                     `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  
exercise                                     `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

### Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`color{red}{two red words}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

### Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1:
  :    
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2:
  :    
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3:
  :    
   and its description may fit on one line

### Comment lines

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only interest in
the Doconce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file.


### Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[name: running text]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. Here goes an example.
[hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically boldface
name and everything surrounded by parenthesis, but with LaTeX
output and the `-DTOTONOTES` option to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`,
colorful margin or inline boxes (using the `todonotes` package)
make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.
The fourth specification above specifies the code environment
explicitly such that the becomes `shpro` even if we copy a part
of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

### LaTeX Mathematics

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$
Here is a single equation:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which results in

$$
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
$$

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.

  * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(Doconce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
PDF document.



*LaTeX Newcommands.* The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway.


### Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latter results in


<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>




### Tables

The table in the section [Section Types](#s) was written with this
syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes Doconce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

### Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\label{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ref{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


### Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name1,name2,name3}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[Publish](https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which Doconce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

### Generalized Citations

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in Doconce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ref[internal][cite][external]

# Example:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing Doconce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
Doconce documents may include movies.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
`ref{label}` references in `internal` are references to labels in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

### Index of Keywords

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
index{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

### Capabilities of The Program `doconce`

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

### Exercises

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


### Environments

Doconce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * `subex`: sub-exercise

 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * `quote`: indented text

 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

### Preprocessing

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... \label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [example document](http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

Making sphinx-testdoc
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.1]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-testdoc/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir-math
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making tmp_admon
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file tmp_admon/conf.py.
Creating file tmp_admon/index.rst.
Creating file tmp_admon/Makefile.
Creating file tmp_admon/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file tmp_admon/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.7]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
