# Test of Markdown input syntax in Doconce

Doconce can recognize basic Markdown as input in the `.do.txt` file
and transform such text to native Doconce.

# Doconce comments also start with #, and can be confused with
# Markdown headings. The confusion is avoided by not having blanks
# after the # character in single-line comments. Multi-line
# comments work well and are never confused with Markdown headings.

<!-- Markdown applies standard HTML

this one without any author name and colon in the beginning.

## Test of inline formatting

Markdown has **boldface** and *emphasize* typesetting, as well
as `inline verbatim computer code`.

**Paragraph headings.** These are written using standard Markdown
boldface syntax.

### Subsubsection heading

The Markdown headings can only be of three types: section, subsection,
and subsubsection.

# Typesetting of computer code

Here is a plain code snippet without language specification:

```
file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
```

The same snippet typeset explicitly as Bash:

```Bash
file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
```

And here is Python:

```Python
from math import sin

def f(x):
    return x*sin(x)

x = 1.4
print f(x)
```

And HTML:

```HTML
<h1>Some heading</h1>
<!-- And a comment -->
```


# Test of quoted sections

> Markdown also features quoted
paragraphs that start with a greater
than sign, either just in the beginning
or at every line.

If a quoted paragraph with blank lines is desired, you
must use `>` on the beginning of every line.

> **NOTE**:
>
> This quoted paragragraph is a simulation of a primitive
> admon in Markdown.

# Test of lists

Markdown applies the dash in itemized lists:

 - This is item 1
 - This is item 2
 - This is item 3

Let us test this in a quoted environment too:

> **List**:
> - This is item 1
> - This is item 2, which cannot be split between lines
> - This is item 3

Enumerated lists go as follows.

 1. Item 1
 2. Item 2
 3. Item 3

# Test of tables

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:


| Item      |    Value | Qty  |
| :-------- | --------:| :--: |
| Computer  | 1600 USD |  5   |
| Phone     |   12 USD |  12  |
| Pipe      |    1 USD | 234  |

# Test of mathematics

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall
n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$
