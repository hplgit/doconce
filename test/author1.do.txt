# Externaldocument: testdoc

========= Generalized References =========
label{genrefs}

Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, DocOnce offers *generalized references* which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the `xr` package,
the generalized references in DocOnce has a syntax that may utilize
the `xr` feature in LaTeX.

The syntax of generalized references reads
!bc
ref[internal][cite][external]
!ec
If all `ref{label}` references in the text `internal` are references
to labels in the present document, the above `ref` command is replaced
by the text `internal`. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is `latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out `internal cite` since the `internal` reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the `refch[internal][cite][external]` syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another LaTeX document, the output is just `cite`.
For all
output formats other than `latex` and `pdflatex`, the `external`
text will be the output.

Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:
!bc
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
With `latex` or `pdflatex` as output, this translates to
!bc
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
if the label `{subsec:ex}` appears in the present DocOnce source, and
otherwise
!bc
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex} in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
In a format different from `latex` and `pdflatex`, the effective DocOnce
text becomes
!bc
As explained in
a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
The rendered text in the current format `${FORMAT}` becomes

!bquote
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
!equote

A reference to an entire external document, which is usually a chapter
if the reference is internal in the DocOnce source, applies the
`refch` syntax:

!bc
As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}]["Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
The output now if `ch:testdoc` is not a label in the document,
becomes in the `latex` and `pdflatex` case

!bc
As explained in
"Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
!ec
That is, the internal reference `Chapter ...` is omitted since
it is not meaningful to refer to an external document as "Chapter".
The resulting rendered text in the current format `${FORMAT}` becomes

!bquote
As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}]["Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
!equote

Note that LaTeX cannot
have links to local files, so a complete URL on the form
`http://...` must be used.

And here is another example with internal references only:

!bc
Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].
!ec
The text is rendered to

!bquote
Generalized references are described in
ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].

========= Test of math =========

# Here we test the chapter heading to see if latex output then has
# book style rather than article style.

Inline math, $a=b$, is the only math in this document.

# Need BIBFILE because of cite{} examples
BIBFILE: papers.pub
