===== Figure and bullet list =====

!bslidecell 00  0.35
!bpop

  * Here is a *wave packet*
  * It can move
  * But here it is just a figure

!epop
!eslidecell

# Test that it is okay to leave out width if there are only two columns

!bslidecell 01

!bpop highlight-red
Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.
And a line more
!epop

[hpl: Here are some notes that can go to notes typesetting
in the slide environment.]

!bnotes
One can also have ordinary notes.
Over multiple lines.

===== Scientific writing needs to address many new media =====

!bpop

 * Old days (1985-2005): mostly black-and-white documents aimed at printing
 * Now: also color PDF, web pages, wikis - for paper, PC, iPad, ...
 * LaTeX writing may be very different from writing in other formats
 * Main problem:
    * LaTeX provide all sorts of fancy packages, but
    * PDF in browsers has limited capabilities (design, navigation)
      compared to native HTML formats
 * Conclusion: We need more than LaTeX

!epop

!split
===== Some math and computer code =====

!bt
\[ f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y \]
!et
Python implementation:

!bc pycod
import numpy as np

def f(x, y, t):
    return np.exp(-x*t)*np.sin(np.pi*y)

class Fancy:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __call__(self, x, y, t):
        return f(x, y, t)

f2 = Fancy()
!ec

!split
===== Admon blocks =====

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

!bnotice Key PDE:
This box has title and math in normal 90 percent font:
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
!et
!enotice

!bpop
!bnotice None
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
!enotice
!epop

!bwarning (small)
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.
