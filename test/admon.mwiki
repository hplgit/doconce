#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Testing admons

By '''hpl'''
==== Aug 30, 2013 ====

== Introduction ==
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


==== Code ====

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>

And some plain text verbatim:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Admonitions ====

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Warning.''' And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.


<ul>
  <li> and a list
  <li> with items
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
}}

Test warning with title:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Watch Out.''' And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
}}

Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

''Block with title''\n
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
''without any icon'' and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.

Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.

The next admonition features a title "Note, eventually!".

<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: illegal-size;
| text = '''Note, eventually!''' Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <math>\theta</math> and <math>\bm{r}</math>:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
</math>
}}

<!-- Test one word with a number -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Point1.''' Ah, we are soon close to the end.
}}


{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
}}


{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' 
<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
</ol>
}}

{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Tip.''' It is of outmost important to


<ol>
<li> stay cool
<li> read hints and tips carefully
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}

Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' And here comes some text with bad news.
}}

==== Going deeper environments ====

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Going deeper.''' We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
</syntaxhighlight>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
</syntaxhighlight>
And then we add a figure too.

==== The end ====

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


{{mbox
| type = Concluding remarks, for the novice.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Concluding remarks, for the novice.''' We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
