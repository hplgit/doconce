#  * Scientific writing = lecture notes, slides, reports, thesis, books,  ...
#  * (Journal papers typeset by journals are out of scope)

!bpop
  * Scope: documents with color{red}{much} *math* and *computer code*
  * Key question: What tools should I use for writing?
  * Default answer: LaTeX
  * Alternative: MS Word w/math
  * Recent popular alternative tools: HTML w/MathJax,
    Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki, IPython notebook

!bslidecell 00
Old days (1985-2005): LaTeX for BW paper output, but now

   o BW books
   o Colorful PDF books (printed and screen)
   o Designed web pages
   o Wikis
   o Blog posts
   o Next new fancy format (iBook w/LaTeX?)

===== Fundamental question =====

When I write some scientific material,

 * a LaTeX document,
 * a blog post (HTML),
 * some web pages (HTML),
 * a Sphinx document,
 * some Markdown files,

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

!bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =====

 * LaTeX inline math: works with all (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki)
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =====

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX (can run separately), just raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; inline tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Page references: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but not on paper!)
!epop

!bpop
Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.

Or:

__Summary.__
Here goes the summary...

!split
===== DocOnce: section headings =====

Headings are surrounded by `=` signs:
!bc
======= This is an H1/chapter heading =======

===== This is an H2/section heading =====

===== This is an H3/subsection heading =====

=== This is an H4/paragraph heading ===

__This is a paragraph heading.__

===== DocOnce: markup and lists =====

!bc
 * Bullet list items start with `*`
   and may span several lines
 * *Emphasized words* are possible
 * _Boldface words_ are also possible
 * color{red}{colored words} too
 * `inline verbatim code` is featured
   o and sublists with enumerated items starting with `o`
   o items are just indented as you would do in email
!ec

This gets rendered as

!split
===== DocOnce: labels, references, index items =====

!bc
# Insert index items in the source
idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).

# Make hyperlink
"some link text": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"

# Hyperlink with complete URL as link text
URL: "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"

===== DocOnce: figures and movies =====

!bnotice
Figure with HTML and LaTeX info, and caption, *all on one line*:

FIGURE: [figdir/myfig, width=300 frac=1.2] My caption. label{fig1}

# This figure will be 300 pixels wide in HTML and span 1.2 times
# the linewidth in LaTeX.
!ec

Movies are also supported:

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]
!ec
and rendered as

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

!split
===== DocOnce: math =====

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.


An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags,
the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
which is rendered as

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
!et


!split
===== DocOnce: displaying code =====

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags:

!bc
|bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec
!ec
This gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

!bnotice Language-dependent typesetting of code:
The `!bc` command can be followed by a specification of the computer
language: `pycod` for Python code snippet, `pypro` for complete Python
program, `fcod` for Fortran snippet, `fpro` for Fortran program, and so
forth (`c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `m` for Matlab).

!split
===== DocOnce: displaying interactive demo code =====
label{slide:pot}

With `!bc pyoptpro` or a file `*.pyopt`, the code applies the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com" for displaying
program flow and state of variables:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/solver.pyopt

===== DocOnce: exercises =====

DocOnce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:
