__Abstract.__
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

# Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
# is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

======= Section 1 =======
label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2
  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
    o first item
    o second item,
      continuing on a new line

__Here is a list with paragraph heading.__

  * item1
  * item2

=== Here is a list with subsubsection heading ===

  * item1
  * item2

!bquote
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote.
!equote

Here are two references. Equation~(ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.
# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html")
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.
# #endif


===== Subsection 1 =====
label{subsec1}

idx{`somefunc` function}

# Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
# and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section ref{sec1} and ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections    ref{subsec1} and ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises ref{demo:ex:1} and ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices     ref{app1} and ref{app2} are also nice elements.


# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

=== Computer code ===

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f fromto: subroutine@
and then just the subroutine,
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f from-to:a comment@^C\s+END1
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(`envir=ccq`):
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f envir=ccq

Testing other code environments. First Python:

!bc
|bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
|ec
!ec
which gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec

# #if FORMAT not in ("rst", "plain", "epytext", "st")
Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before code.

__Paragraph heading before code.__

!bc pycod
def g(y):
    return y+1
!ec

=== Subsubsection heading before code ===

!bc pycod
def h(z):
    return z+1
!ec
# #endif

# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html", "latex", "pdflatex")
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:
# #else
Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.
# #endif

!bc pyoptpro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
!ec

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:
# #else
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).
# #endif

!bc pyscpro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
!ec

## Should also test that one can read .pyopt and .pysc programs

Then Cython:
!bc cycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
!ec

Standard Python shell sessions:

!bc pyshell
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
!ec

IPython sessions:

!bc ipy
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
!ec


# This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
!bc cpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
!ec
# The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
And a little bit of Fortran:

!bc
|bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
|ec
!ec
which then is typeset as

!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec

HTML:

!bc htmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
!ec

System call:
!bc sys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
!ec

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

!bc
|bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
|ec
!ec
results in

!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec

# Here goes hidden code.
# Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.

!bc pyhid
def f(x):
    """Secret, hidden function to be defined."""
    return 42
!ec

!bc fhid
       subroutine helper1(x)
       real*8 x
       x = 42
       return

       subroutine helper2(x)
       real*8 x
       x = 43
       return
!ec

Finally, `!bc do` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

!bc do
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

|bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
|ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
|et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
!ec

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is potentially not smart
since latex use ! in the `Verb` typesetting, but this should now
be fixed: test `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `!bsummary`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}` in inline
verbatim text. Since the exclamation mark is used as delimiter
in LaTeX inline verbatim, we need to test it, as in `a != b`,
and a DocOnce directive a la `!bc`.

# #if FORMAT not in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html")
The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format ${FORMAT}.
# #endif
Here is some color{red}{red} color and an attempt to write color{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak. <linebreak>
And one more.} Some formats will only display <linebreak>
this correctly when HTML is the output format. <linebreak>
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

=== Running OS commands ===

@@@OSCMD python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'

=== Footnotes ===

Here is a test of footnotes[^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items
 * even with math $\nabla^2u$ [^math1]
 * and code `h[i] += 1` [^code],
 * and "links": "http://google.com" [^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: URL: "google.com" is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was used
used above.

!bnotice Non-breaking space character
This paragraph aims to test "non-breaking space character":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space", and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~"link": "http://google.com"~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in `[~x for x in y]` or in `y=~x`, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
!enotice

===== Subsection 2: Testing figures =====
label{subsec:ex}
idx{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. label{fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

idx{movies}


# Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long
caption spanning
several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`
as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. label{myfig}

# Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx")
Test SVG figure:

FIGURE: [http://openclipart.org/people/jpneok/junebug.svg, width=200]
# #endif

# Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs
# #if FORMAT == "mwiki"
FIGURE: [testfigs/df_plot.png, width=800] This is a wikimedia figure file.

# Non-uploaded file with no caption
FIGURE: [testfigs/df2s8765s_plot.png, width=200, frac=0.4]
# #endif


__Remark.__
Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


# Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

===== The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?) =====
label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
!bc
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
!ec

__More on $\theta$.__ Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}
!et

Or with align with label and numbers:

!bt
\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
!et

% if FORMAT == "sphinx":
Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.
% endif
% if FORMAT == "mwiki":
The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.
% endif

===== Custom Environments =====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.


===== Tables =====
label{subsec:table}

idx{test index with `verbatim text` which is possible}
idx{test `two` (separate) `verbatim expressions` which is also possible}
idx{index with!subindex}

# index with comma could fool sphinx
idx{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in LaTeX, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
label{mytab}
}

% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\end{table}
% endif

The DocOnce source code reads
!bc ccq

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

|--------------------------|
|$i$|$h_i$|$\bar T_i$|`L_i`|
|-l-----r-------r----r-----|
|0   |0     |288   |-0.0065|
|1   |11,000|216   |0.0	   |
|2   |20,000|216   |0.001  |
|3   |32,000|228   |0.0028 |
|4   |47,000|270   |0.0	   |
|5   |51,000|270   |-0.0028|
|6   |71,000|214   |`NaN`  |
|--------------------------|

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):
## +`v_2` does not work, need space + `v_2`

|-----------------------------------------|
| exact | `v_1`   |$a_i$ + `v_2`|`verb_3_`|
|---r--------r---------r-----------r------|
|9      | 9.62    | 5.57      |  8.98     |
|-20    | -23.39  | -7.65     | -19.93    |
|10     | 17.74   | -4.50     |  9.96     |
|0      | -9.19   | 4.13      | -0.26     |
|-----------------------------------------|

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

|-----------------------------|
| $S$         | command       |
|-----l---------------r-------|
| $||a_0||$   | `norm|length` |
| $x\cap y$   | `x|y`         |
|-----------------------------|
# #if FORMAT == 'plain'

NOTE: The above table is not correctly handled in the plain text format
because in this format inline verbatim text look like normal text,
and the first line in the table then looks like three columns.
# #endif

Finally, a table with math
# #if FORMAT in ("rst", "html", "sphinx", "pandoc")
(`bm` that expands to `boldsymbol`, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
# #endif
and URLs.

===== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` =====

__Files `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.__ Here is
some text.

# Test various types of headlines
% for heading in ('_Just bold_', '*Just emphasize*', '`Just verbatim`', '_Bold_ beginning', '*Emphasize* beginning', '`Verbatim` beginning', 'Maybe _bold end_', 'Maybe *emphasize end*', 'Maybe `verbatim end`', 'The middle has _bold_ word', 'The middle has *emphasize* word', 'The middle has `verbatim` word'):
===== ${heading} =====

Some text.

% endfor
% for heading in ('*Just emphasize*', '`Just verbatim`', '*Emphasize* beginning', '`Verbatim beginning`', 'Maybe *emphasize end*', 'Maybe `verbatim end`', 'The middle has *emphasize* word', 'The middle has `verbatim` word'):

__${heading}.__ Some text.

% endfor

__Ampersand.__
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H & M, but written
as `Hennes & Mauritz` and `H & M`.
A sole `&` must also work.
# Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

!bc
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
!ec

__Quotes.__
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like `.txt`.


===== Bibliography test =====

Here is an example: cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work cite{Langtangen_1988d} and cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book cite{Langtangen:91} and the
cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.


===== Example: Examples can be typeset as exercises =====
label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


!bsubex
State some problem.

!bsol
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
State some other problem.

!bhint
A hint can be given.
!ehint

!bhint
Maybe even another hint?
!ehint

!bsol
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.
!esol
!esubex


===== URLs =====
label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl", or
the entire URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".  Here is a
plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt", or
URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link with
newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or "hpl" :
"http://folk.uio.no/hpl". Also `file:///` works: "link to a
file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or just a "mail link": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or a raw URL: "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
"Newton-Cotes":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" formulas
and a "good book":
"http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1". Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas"
and URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monofont link text get a footnote (unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
"`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py", "`ball1.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py",
and "`ball2.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py".


# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
# format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

# Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
# if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
"google": "http://google.com", "google": "http://google.com", and
"google": "http://google.com", which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

===== Test of Some LaTeX Fixes =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.  2 which is also often used.
Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen, or maybe also prof.  Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr.    Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch. ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App. ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no. $i$ of DocOnce features.
A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.

======= LaTeX Mathematics =======

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
!et


% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', 'html', 'pandoc'):
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

# Torture tests
file=myfile_should_be_a_part_of_the_text
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint

!bhint
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.
!ehint

!bans
If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
!eans

!bsol

=== Remarks ===

Remarks with such a subsubsection heading would previously mark
the beginning of a new exercise and cause trouble. Maybe a list

 o Mark 1.
 o Mark 2.

===== Not an exercise =====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

===== Project: Compute a Probability =====

# Minimalistic exercise

label{demo:ex:2}

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

!bhint
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
!ehint

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

===== Project: Explore Distributions of Random Circles =====

label{proj:circle1}
file=circles.pdf

The formula for a circle is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
!et
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
!ec

# Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
# which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

!bsubex
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

!bans

===== {Exercise}: Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix =====

# Another minimalistic exercise

Just some text. And some math saying that $e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

!bt
\[ \exp{(0)} = 1 \]

And a test that the code `lambda x: x+2` is correctly placed here:

!bc

===== Exercise: Solution of differential equation =====
label{sec:this:exer:de}


!bquiz
H: SOlution of differential equation
K: derivatives; exponential function; equation, differential; differential equation
Q: Given

!bt
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 \]
!et
What is the solution of this equation?

L: quiz:diff:eq1

Cr: $y=e^{-y}$

Cw: $y=e^{y}$
E: Almost, but the sign is wrong (note the minus!).

Cw:
!bc pycod
from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)
!ec

E: Ooops, forgot a minus: `exp(-x)`, otherwise this Python code
must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural,
though, to write the solution to the problem
in mathematical notation:

!bt
\[ y(x) = e^{-y}.\]
!et

Cw: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.
E: Equations with derivatives can be solved;
they are termed *differential
equations*.

Cw: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for $x$ or $y$, not a function $y(x)$.
E: Equations where the unknown is a function, as $y(x)$
here, are called *differential equations*, and are solved by
special techniques.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "Script for Introduction to Version Control":
"http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "Dropbox":
"http://dropbox.com" and "Google Drive": "http://drive.google.com".
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

# Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion:
not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to URL:"http://dropbox.com" and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

!bquote
*Fun is fun.*--- Unknown.
!equote

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.
