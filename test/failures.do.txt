# Text with wrong doconce format

A list followed by a code block works okay:

  * Third point
  * Fourth point
!bc cod
some verbatime stuff
!ec

=== Section heading before code is caught by the syntax check ===
label{my} idx{failure}

!bc
more verbatime stuff
!ec

Next we see if backslashes are detected: \label{mylab}\idx{youridx}
And a reference to \cite{mybook}.

__Paragraph before code is bad.__

# But here it could be fooled by a comment

!bc
More verbatim stuff.
!ec

Can we successfully say `__call__` and `__add__` and avoid having them as
bad paragraphs?

Figure with no comma between filename and options:

# Comment before list

Normal text.
