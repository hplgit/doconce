========= Automatic execution of code blocks =========

Compile this document with

!bc sh-t
doconce format execute.do.txt --execute
!ec

Hidden execution cells can be used to perform operations that need to be done
before the following cells are executed:

!bc pycod-e
import os
os.listdir(".")
a = 1
e = 0
f = 3
!ec

This is a cell that should execute automatically:

!bc pycod
b = 2
c = a + b
print("The result is {}".format(c))
c
!ec

======= Plotting =======

This is a cell that should plot and output:

!bc pycod
from pylab import *
x = linspace(0, 10, 100)
plot(x, x*x)
show()
!ec

To improve quality when exporting to LaTeX, the following code has automatically
been run to enable PDF export in notebooks.

!bc pycod-t
from IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats
set_matplotlib_formats('png', 'pdf')
!ec

======= Ignore output =======

Predefined output can be omitted by passing `--ignore_output` to DocOnce.
This will remove all environments ending with `out`.

!bc pycod
a = 2
print(a)
!ec

!bc pyout 
2
!ec

======= Not executed =======

This is a code block that should not be executed:

!bc pycod-t
while True:
    i = 2
!ec

This is some *formatted* stuff, which is _underlined_ and stuff and maybe even
contains $a + 2b$.

======= Code with errors =======

If code contains errors, it will still be run and the exception shown as part
of the output:

!bc pycod
for a in range(10)
    print(a)
!ec

======= Opening files =======

The working directory is the same as the .do.txt file.
You may want to use `os.chdir` to change the directory.

!bc pycod
with open("../LICENSE") as f:
    print(f.read())
!ec
